The bank downgraded the stock to hold from buy and lowered its price target to $188 from $206, citing \"its higher exposure to beef prices.\" This suggests an upside of less than 1% from Monday's close.\n\nGrowing beef demand is the primary factor contributing to inflation, but diminishing supply is also making an impact, according to Bartlett. Analysts say live cattle prices will rise by 7.3% in 2026 and 3.5% in 2027, which is primarily driven by middle-to-higher income consumers.

Balancing the risks to the labor market against inflation that she said is running \"stubbornly high,\" Logan said she is more concerned about prices.\n\n\"All of this suggests to me that our current stance of policy may be very close to neutral and providing little restraint on economic activity and inflation,\" she said in a speech delivered in Austin.\n\n\"We will learn in coming months whether inflation is coming down to our target and whether the labor market will remain stable. If so, this would tell me that our current policy stance is appropriate and no further rate cuts are needed to achieve our dual mandate goals,\" Logan added.

The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) hovered around the flatline.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' January nonfarm payrolls report — which had been delayed due to a partial government shutdown that [ended on Feb. 3](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/house-republicans-reopen-us-government-shutdown.html) — showed job growth of 130,000 last month. Economists polled by Dow Jones had called for a gain of 55,000. The latest figure also marked a sizable increase from December, which was downwardly revised to 48,000.\n\nThe unemployment rate also landed at 4.3%, a bit below the Dow Jones forecast for 4.4%.\n\nWhile the report showed the strongest job gains in more than a year, areas of growth remained concentrated in just a few sectors, predominantly health care-related, which added 124,000 total positions. That was double the normal growth from 2025. Moreover, there is the continuing specter of downward revisions over the labor market, particularly after every month in 2025 saw adjustments lower. With benchmark annual revisions combined with monthly moves through the year, average monthly job growth last year was just 15,000.\n\n\"This is generally a good sign, as you'd expect, but we are certainly not out of the woods yet with respect to the labor market. 'Moving in the right direction' would be a better description. The unemployment rate is gradually improving, but there are still plenty of signs that the labor market remains exceedingly weak,\" Rick Wedell, CIO at RFG Advisory, said, citing a low quit rate as one example.\n\n\"In this environment, it is clear that we still have a long way to go before the labor market can be considered 'solid,'\" he added.\n\n[Treasury yields had initially jumped](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/us-treasury-yields-investors-await-delayed-january-jobs-report.html) on the heels of the report as it at first fueled investor optimism that the economy was on firm footing. At session highs, the Dow was up more than 300 points, or 0.6%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.7% and the Nasdaq jumped 0.9%. However, Federal Reserve interest rate cut odds were reduced, which could have thrown a wrench into that enthusiasm.\n\nThe jobs report follows weaker-than-expected consumer data released on Tuesday. That report showed that [consumer spending in December was flat](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/december-retail-sales-were-flat-missing-expectations.html), missing the 0.4% monthly gain expected from economists polled by Dow Jones.\n\n\"After a long period of prognosticators offering a tepid outlook for the economy based on a weakening labor market, this print provides a solid datapoint on the side of robust economic growth, an improving labor market and wage growth that can support consumer spending,\" said Brad Smith, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors. \"The Fed will take this point in to its calculus when it makes its decision next month on whether to hold rates steady. With its wait-and-see data dependent stance, this will surely put the balance towards a hold.\"\n\nSoftware stocks, which were a [key driver of last week's rout](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/is-the-ai-bubble-popping-itself-software-rout-raises-concerns.html) amid [fears of disruption from artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/ai-anthropic-tools-saas-software-stocks-selloff.html), came under pressure yet again Tuesday. [Salesforce](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRM/) was down 4%, while [ServiceNow](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NOW/) fell 5%. The [iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IGV/) dropped 3%, putting it 30% below its 52-week high.

Shares of digital infrastructure provider [Vertiv](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/) surged 18% after the company posted a fourth-quarter earnings beat and issued a strong 2026 outlook.

The total also was an improvement over December, which saw a gain of 48,000 after a slight downward revision.\n\nThe unemployment rate edged lower to 4.3%, below the forecast to stay unchanged at 4.4% from the prior month. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons slipped to 8%, down 0.4 percentage point from December.\n\nMarkets rose following the news, with [stock market futures](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/stock-market-today-live-updates.html) ticking higher. Treasury yields also posted strong gains.\n\nThe report, delayed nearly a week by the partial government shutdown that ended Feb. 3, held consistent with a labor market in a low-growth mode, though with only scattered signs of increasing layoffs. January was the best month for payroll growth since December 2024, following a year in which job creation averaged just 15,000 a month.\n\nPresident [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) touted the numbers as the sign of a strong economy, and again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.\n\n\"GREAT JOBS NUMBERS, FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED!\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"The United States of America should be paying MUCH LESS on its Borrowings (BONDS!). We are again the strongest Country in the World, and should therefore be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far.\"\n\nIn addition to the monthly numbers, the BLS released final benchmark revisions for the period of April 2024 to March 2025. Those numbers saw the initial counts revised lower by a total 898,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. That was a bit lower than the 911,000 figure for the initial estimate last September but around Wall Street expectations.\n\nAs has often been the case for the U.S. labor market, health care led job gains in January, adding 82,000 positions. Social assistance also rose, up 42,000 as the two categories were responsible for almost all the net job creation. Construction saw a gain of 33,000 following a year in which the sector saw little increase.\n\nSeveral categories posted losses.\n\nFederal government jobs fell by 34,000 as some of those laid off last year through Department of Government Efficiency cuts but accepted deferred resignations fell off the payroll count, the BLS said. Financial activities saw a decline of 22,000.\n\n\"It was a January job surge,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"The surprisingly strong job gains in January were driven mainly by health care and social assistance. But it is enough to stabilize the job market and send the unemployment rate slightly lower. This is still a largely frozen job market, but it is stabilizing. That's an encouraging sign to start the year, especially after the hiring recession in 2025.\"\n\nOn wages, average hourly earnings increased 0.4% for the month, 0.1 percentage point higher than expected, and 3.7% annually, in line with the forecast.\n\nWall Street expectations were muted for the report, following a series of other releases showing slow private sector gains, elevated layoff plans and shrinking job openings. Even White House officials, such as National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, had been tamping down expectations.\n\n\"After a long period of prognosticators offering a tepid outlook for the economy based on a weakening labor market, this print provides a solid datapoint on the side of robust economic growth, an improving labor market and wage growth that can support consumer spending,\" said Brad Smith, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors\n\nThe prior year featured consistently modest gains and several months of negative growth for payrolls. Every month in 2025 saw negative revisions, even after President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) sacked former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in early August after he criticized large downward adjustments to the job totals. November also saw a downward revision that took the final number down to 41,000, a cut of 15,000 from the prior estimate.\n\nAmid the labor market slowness, a White House crackdown on illegal immigration helped dampen labor demand, while a general climate of uncertainty over tariffs and inflation also pushed businesses into tabling plans for workforce growth.\n\nHowever, the January numbers provide some reason for optimism.\n\nWhile the establishment survey sho\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: Job Growth Was Overstated, New Data Shows - The New York Times\nLink: https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/business/economy/january-jobs-report-revisions.html\nAge: 2 hours ago\nSnippet: Annual revisions show that <strong>employers added far fewer jobs in 2024 and 2025 than previously estimated</strong>.\nContent:\n(HTTP 403)\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: January 2026 jobs report: US economy added 130K jobs amid solid growth | Fox Business\nLink: https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-jobs-report-january-2026\nAge: 2 hours ago\nSnippet: Today&#x27;s data shows an <strong>acceleration in employment that was strong enough to drive unemployment lower</strong> – vindication for Chair Powell&#x27;s holding pattern,&quot; said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\nContent:\nThe U.S. economy posted solid job growth in January as employers hired at a steady pace to start 2026 as the Federal Reserve evaluates the need for rate cuts in the months ahead.\n\n### **What does the January 2026 jobs report say?**\n\nThe Labor Department on Wednesday reported that employers [added 130,000 jobs](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/jobs) in January.

The Fed has two mandates: to achieve price stability and foster full employment. Its primary tool to achieve these goals is by adjusting interest rates. When prices are rising too quickly and inflation is above the Fed’s 2% target, it raises interest rates, increasing borrowing costs throughout the economy. This results in a stronger US Dollar (USD) as it makes the US a more attractive place for international investors to park their money. When inflation falls below 2% or the Unemployment Rate is too high, the Fed may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing, which weighs on the Greenback.\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) holds eight policy meetings a year, where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) assesses economic conditions and makes monetary policy decisions. The FOMC is attended by twelve Fed officials – the seven members of the Board of Governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four of the remaining eleven regional Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\n\nIn extreme situations, the Federal Reserve may resort to a policy named Quantitative Easing (QE). QE is the process by which the Fed substantially increases the flow of credit in a stuck financial system. It is a non-standard policy measure used during crises or when inflation is extremely low. It was the Fed’s weapon of choice during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. It involves the Fed printing more Dollars and using them to buy high grade bonds from financial institutions. QE usually weakens the US Dollar.\n\nQuantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse process of QE, whereby the Federal Reserve stops buying bonds from financial institutions and does not reinvest the principal from the bonds it holds maturing, to purchase new bonds. It is usually positive for the value of the US Dollar.\n\n--- Result 4 ---\nTitle: Treasury yields fall after retail sales miss expectations\nLink: https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/treasury-yields-ten-year-markets-retail-sales-data.html\nAge: 1 day ago\nSnippet: The 10-year Treasury yield inched lower as investors looked ahead to retail sales data for December coming out later in the day.\nContent:\n![Experts break down the December retail sales data](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108263795-17707314761770731474-43951960045-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1770731476&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y)\n\nwatch now\n\nU.S. Treasury yields fell on Tuesday after the [latest retail sales report](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/december-retail-sales-were-flat-missing-expectations.html) missed expectations.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was more than 5 basis points lower at 4.141%, as was the [30-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US30Y/) yield at 4.781%.

Forecasts point to a slight cooling in annual inflation to 2.5%, according to the same survey.\n\nThere will be data on weekly initial jobless claims on Thursday as well.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are continuing to track developments in China after Bloomberg News reported that authorities have encouraged banks to scale back exposure to U.S. Treasurys due to concerns over concentration risk and volatility.\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: Gold, Silver Prices Today Live Updates: Will gold, silver prices touch new highs in coming days? - The Times of India\nLink: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-silver-rate-today-live-updates-mcx-gold-price-today-comex-silver-prices-gold-24-carat-dollar-etf-buy-sell-latest-news/liveblog/128186926.cms\nAge: 4 hours ago\nSnippet: “Gold and silver prices rose in the early morning trade after falling briefly in the yesterday’s session, as US Treasury bond yields fell after data showed December retail sales growth stalled, signalling a softening economy ahead of key jobs data. US yields and Dollar index fell after a raft of data suggested the economy may be softening, giving the US Federal Reserve more room to cut interest rates.\nContent:\n20:31 (IST) Feb 11\n\nSilver outperforms gold amid easing US economic signals, says expert\n\n\"MCX gold rose nearly 1 per cent, reclaiming levels above Rs 1.58 lakh per 10 grams, while silver outperformed the yellow metal with around a 3 per cent gain, crossing Rs 2.60 lakh per kg,\" Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk, said.

The white metal had slumped by Rs 10,072, or nearly 4 per cent, to settle at Rs 2,52,548 per kg on Tuesday.\n\nGold futures also witnessed value buying with the April contract rising Rs 1,397, or 0.89 per cent, to Rs 1,58,200 per 10 grams.

Ex auto sales were also flat Vs the forecast of 0.3%.\n\nNonfarm payroll report and January inflation data (to be released on February 13) will be crucial for short term moves in the metal.\n\nGold is currently caught between two opposing major factors: easing geopolitical tensions and weakening US job market.\n\nGold is expected to range trade ahead of the US job data. A weaker job report may help the metal test the resistance at $5125, a decisive breach of which will open way to test $5200 resistance, whereas an encouraging job report will weigh on the metal.

Here, we can also observe that most of ETFs are continued to sustain over their respective 50-DEMA level like Mirae Asset Gold ETF sustained 139.55, GoldBees sustained over 118.68. These are the crucial support areas of these ETFs. Since Gold price in India is holding its breadth over 150,000 level, we may expect Sideways-to-Bullish momentum in Gold ETFs.\n\nSince Gold is outperforming the Silver price in past few sessions after panic fall in International and Indian market, Silver ETFs are also underperforming compared to Gold ETFs. Unlike Gold ETFs, most of ETFs have not rebounded much after a fall. Looking at technical charts of most of Silver ETFs, we can observe that prices have rebounded to 23% of Fib.

The January jobs report provided short-term relief about labor market strength, but the dramatic downward revisions to 2025 data (from 584K to 181K total jobs) reveal underlying weakness. Markets initially rallied but gave back gains as traders recalibrated Federal Reserve rate cut expectations.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n\n1. **Labor Market Stabilization vs. Historical Weakness**: While January's 130K jobs beat expectations, it's still below the 143K added in January 2025. The benchmark revision showing only 181K jobs added in all of 2025 (vs. 2M in 2024) confirms a significant slowdown.\n\n2. **Fed Policy Uncertainty**: Strong January data gives the Fed cover to remain on hold. Rate cut expectations pushed from March to July. Dallas Fed's Logan suggests \"current policy stance may be very close to neutral.\"\n\n3. **AI Disruption Fear Weighing on Software**: Software stocks in bear market territory (IGV ETF down 30% from highs) as market fears generative AI tools will disrupt traditional SaaS business models. Google's Project Genie and tax-strategy tools from startups amplifying concerns.\n\n4. **Consumer Spending Weakness**: December retail sales flat (0%) vs. 0.4% expected suggests consumers are pulling back despite rising stock market.\n\n5. **Concentrated Job Growth**: January gains heavily concentrated in healthcare (+82K) and social assistance (+42K). Manufacturing only added 5K jobs. Federal government shed 34K positions.\n\n**What to Watch:** Friday's January CPI report will be critical. If inflation remains elevated (above 2.5%), combined with stronger employment, the Fed will have little urgency to cut rates. Markets pricing in 58 basis points of easing for full year, but this could decrease further if inflation surprises to the upside.\n\n**Risk Factors:** Software sector volatility on AI fears, persistent inflation limiting Fed flexibility, consumer spending weakness, geopolitical tensions (US-Iran, Middle East), potential for further job revisions showing 2025 was even weaker than now estimated.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Disclaimer\n\n*This report is generated by an automated AI agent for informational purposes only.
