Follow these steps to build a new WAT system from a problem description or n8n workflow JSON.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **problem_description**: A natural language description of the system to build, OR an n8n workflow JSON file\n- **system_name**: A lowercase-with-dashes name for the new system\n- **enable_agent_teams**: Boolean — whether to use Agent Teams for parallelizable tasks (optional, default false)\n\n## Outputs\n\n- A complete WAT system in `systems/{system_name}/` containing:\n  - `CLAUDE.md` — operating instructions\n  - `workflow.md` — the system's process workflow\n  - `tools/` — Python tool files\n  - `.github/workflows/` — GitHub Actions workflow files\n  - `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies\n  - `README.md` — setup and usage instructions\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Intake\n\nReceive and classify the input.\n\n1. Read the `problem_description` input\n2. **Is this an n8n workflow JSON?**\n   - Check if the input is valid JSON containing n8n workflow structure (nodes, connections)\n   - **If yes**: Route to Step 1b (n8n Conversion)\n   - **If no**: Continue to Step 2 with the problem description as-is\n\n### Step 1b: n8n Conversion\n\nConvert an existing n8n workflow into WAT format.\n\n1. Parse the n8n JSON using `factory/tools/convert_n8n.py`\n2. Reference `converters/n8n_node_map.md` to translate every node type\n3. Map each n8n element:\n   - **Trigger nodes** (Webhook, Schedule, Manual) → GitHub Actions triggers\n   - **Action nodes** (HTTP Request, Function, etc.) → Python tools\n   - **Logic nodes** (IF, Switch, Merge) → Decision points in workflow.md\n   - **Connections** → Step ordering and data flow in workflow.md\n4. Extract the underlying workflow logic as a structured design\n5. Preserve the original n8n JSON as `reference/original_n8n.json` in the output system\n6. Continue to Step 3 with the translated design\n\n**Failure mode**: If the n8n JSON is malformed or contains unsupported node types, log the specific issues and generate a partial conversion with TODO markers for unsupported elements.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Research\n\nIdentify available tools and resources for the system.\n\n1. Read `config/mcp_registry.md` — what MCPs are available?\n2. Read `library/tool_catalog.md` — what reusable tool patterns exist?\n3. Read `library/patterns.md` — does this problem match a known pattern?\n4. For each capability the system needs:\n   - Check if an MCP provides it (preferred — less code to maintain)\n   - Check if a tool pattern exists in the catalog (reusable — faster to implement)\n   - Plan a custom tool if nothing exists (document as a new pattern candidate)\n5. Document the research findings: which MCPs, patterns, and tools will be used\n\n**Failure mode**: If the MCP registry is empty or missing, fall back to direct HTTP/API tools. The system must work without any specific MCP.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Design\n\nArchitect the workflow for the new system.\n\n1. Break the problem into discrete steps — each step should do one thing clearly\n2. Define the order: which steps depend on which?\n3. Identify decision points: where does the workflow branch based on conditions?\n4. Define failure modes for each step: what can go wrong and what's the fallback?\n5. Define inputs and outputs for each step\n6. **Design Subagents** — identify specialist subagents for the system:\n   - **Every system gets subagents**. Subagents are the DEFAULT delegation mechanism. For each major phase or capability in the workflow, define a specialist subagent.\n   - For each subagent, define:\n     - **name**: lowercase-with-hyphens identifier (e.g., `search-specialist`, `data-processor`)\n     - **description**: When Claude should delegate to this subagent (used for automatic delegation)\n     - **tools**: Which Claude Code tools this subagent needs (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, etc.) — grant only what's needed\n     - **model**: `sonnet` for most tasks, `haiku` for simple/fast tasks, `opus` for complex reasoning\n     - **permissionMode**: `default` unless the subagent needs autonomous writes (`acceptEdits`)\n     - **system_prompt**: Detailed instructions — the subagent's domain expertise, how to use its tools, expected inputs/outputs, error handling\n   - **Delegation hierarchy** (critical):\n     - **Subagents are the default** for all task delegation within a system. When the workflow reaches a phase, delegate to its specialist subagent.\n     - **Agent Teams is ONLY used** when the design identifies 3+ truly independent tasks that can run in parallel. Agent Teams is a parallelization optimization, not a delegation mechanism.\n     - A system can use BOTH: subagents for delegation AND Agent Teams for parallel execution of independent subagent tasks.\n   - Document all subagents in the design output — they will be generated in Step 5b\n7. **Agent Teams Analysis** — evaluate whether this system ALSO benefits from Agent Teams:\n   - **Count independent tasks**: List all tasks that have no data dependencies on each other\n   - **Apply the 3+ Independent Tasks Rule**:\n     - **3 or more independent tasks** → Recommend Agent Teams. Flag these tasks for parallel execution with the native team lead/teammate pattern. Set `enable_agent_teams` to true.\n     - **Fewer than 3 independent tasks** → Sequential execution is sufficient. Note in the design that Agent Teams is not recommended.\n   - **Assess parallelization benefit**: Will concurrent execution meaningfully reduce total time? (e.g., 3 API calls at 10s each → 10s parallel vs 30s sequential = meaningful)\n   - **Check merge complexity**: Can the parallel results be combined without complex reconciliation? If merging is harder than the parallel speedup, prefer sequential.\n   - **Document the decision**: Record in the design whether Agent Teams is recommended, which tasks would run in parallel, and the rationale\n   - **If Agent Teams is recommended**: Define team roles:\n     - **Team Lead responsibilities**: What the coordinator does (create task list, spawn teammates, merge results, quality control)\n     - **Teammate definitions**: For each parallel task, define the scoped instructions, expected inputs, and expected outputs\n     - **Shared task list structure**: What tasks appear on the list, their dependencies (blockedBy/blocks), and completion criteria\n   - **If Agent Teams is NOT recommended**: Design for sequential execution only. Note why (e.g., \"all tasks depend on previous output\" or \"only 2 independent tasks — overhead not justified\")\n   - **Regardless of recommendation**: The design MUST include a sequential execution path. Agent Teams is always an optimization, never a requirement.\n8. Select the workflow pattern from `library/patterns.md` that best fits (or define a new one)\n\n**Failure mode**: If the problem is too vague to design a clear workflow, generate a minimal viable workflow with TODO markers and document what clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3b: Factory Parallel Build (Agent Teams)\n\n**This step applies to the factory's own build process, not the generated system.**\n\nWhen the factory is building a complex system (4+ tools or multiple independent workflow phases), it can use Agent Teams to generate artifacts in parallel. This accelerates the build without affecting the output.\n\n1. **Check if Agent Teams is enabled**: Read `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` from the environment\n2. **Assess build complexity**:\n   - Count the number of tools to generate\n   - Count the number of independent generation steps (workflow, tools, Actions, CLAUDE.md)\n   - **If 4+ generation artifacts AND Agent Teams enabled**: Use parallel build\n   - **Otherwise**: Continue to Steps 4–7 sequentially (skip this step)\n3. **If parallel build**: The factory team lead creates a shared task list and spawns teammates:\n   - **Task: Generate Workflow** — Teammate generates `workflow.md` from the design (Step 4)\n   - **Task: Generate Tools** — Teammate generates all Python tools from the design (Step 5)\n   - **Task: Generate GitHub Actions** — Teammate generates `.github/workflows/` files (Step 6)\n   - **Task: Generate CLAUDE.md** — Teammate generates the system's CLAUDE.md (Step 7)\n   - Each teammate receives the full design from Step 3 as context\n   - Each teammate writes its output to the system's output directory\n4. **Team lead collects and validates**: After all teammates complete, the team lead:\n   - Verifies all expected files were generated\n   - Checks cross-references (e.g., workflow.md mentions tools that exist in `tools/`)\n   - Resolves any conflicts or inconsistencies\n   - Proceeds to Step 8 (Test)\n\n**Sequential fallback**: If Agent Teams is not enabled, Steps 4–7 execute sequentially as defined below. Results are identical.\n\n**Failure mode**: If a teammate fails, the team lead falls back to generating that artifact sequentially. A partial parallel build is still faster than fully sequential.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Generate Workflow\n\nWrite the system's `workflow.md`.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/generate_workflow.py` with the design from Step 3\n2. Follow the structure in `factory/templates/workflow_template.md`\n3. Include:\n   - Clear header with system name and purpose\n   - Inputs section with expected parameters\n   - Outputs section with deliverables\n   - Numbered steps with sub-steps\n   - Decision points with bold conditional text\n   - Failure modes and fallback steps for every step\n4. **If Agent Teams applies**: Include parallel execution sections using `factory/templates/agent_teams_template.md`\n   - Define which steps run as sub-agents\n   - Define the merge/coordination logic\n   - Include a sequential fallback section\n\n**Failure mode**: If workflow generation fails, write a minimal skeleton workflow.md with the key steps and TODO markers.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Generate Tools\n\nWrite Python tools for each action step.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/generate_tools.py` with the workflow steps from Step 4\n2. For each action step in the workflow:\n   - Check `library/tool_catalog.md` for a reusable pattern\n   - If found: adapt the pattern for this system's specific needs\n   - If not found: generate a new tool following `factory/templates/tool_template.py`\n3. Every tool MUST have:\n   - Module docstring (purpose, inputs, outputs)\n   - `main()` entry point\n   - `try/except` error handling\n   - `logging` integration\n   - Type hints\n4. **If Agent Teams is used**: Generate sub-agent task definitions using `factory/tools/generate_agent_teams.py`\n5. Generate `requirements.txt` listing all Python dependencies\n\n**Failure mode**: If a tool cannot be generated (e.g., requires an unknown API), create a stub tool with clear TODO markers and document what's missing.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5b: Generate Subagents\n\nCreate `.claude/agents/` markdown files for the system's specialist subagents.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/generate_subagents.py` with the subagent definitions from Step 3\n2. For each subagent defined in the design:\n   - Generate a markdown file following `factory/templates/subagent_template.md`\n   - YAML frontmatter with: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `permissionMode`\n   - Detailed system prompt in the markdown body covering:\n     - What the subagent specializes in\n     - Which tools to use and how\n     - Expected inputs and outputs\n     - Step-by-step execution instructions\n     - Failure handling procedures\n3. Place all subagent files in `{system_dir}/.claude/agents/`\n4. Validate each subagent file:\n   - Frontmatter parses as valid YAML\n   - `name` is lowercase-with-hyphens only\n   - `tools` lists only valid Claude Code tools\n   - `model` is one of: sonnet, opus, haiku, inherit\n   - System prompt is non-empty and specific to the domain\n\n**Failure mode**: If a subagent file fails validation, fix the issue and regenerate. If generation fails entirely, create stub subagent files with TODO markers — the system should still work without subagents (Claude will use tools directly).\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Generate GitHub Actions\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/` files for the new system.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/generate_github_actions.py` with the system design\n2. Using `factory/templates/github_action_template.yml`, create the main workflow:\n   - Configure triggers based on the system's needs (dispatch, cron, webhook)\n   - Set up Python environment and dependencies\n   - Inject required secrets (reference GitHub Secrets, NEVER hardcode)\n   - Run Claude Code with the system's workflow.md\n   - Commit results back to the repo\n   - Configure failure notifications\n   - Set `timeout-minutes` on every job\n3. Using `factory/templates/agent_hq_template.yml`, create `agent_hq.yml`:\n   - Respond to issue assignment and @claude mentions\n   - Parse issue body as task input\n   - Submit results as draft PR\n   - Support iterative feedback\n\n**Failure mode**: If trigger configuration is ambiguous, default to `workflow_dispatch` with a manual input parameter.\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Generate CLAUDE.md\n\nWrite the system's operating instructions.\n\n1. Using `factory/templates/claude_md_template.md`, generate CLAUDE.md with:\n   - System identity and purpose\n   - Required MCPs and their alternatives\n   - Expected inputs and outputs\n   - How to execute the workflow\n   - **Subagents section**: List all subagents, when to delegate to each, and how to chain them\n   - **Delegation hierarchy**: Subagents are the default, Agent Teams only for parallel execution\n   - Agent Teams configuration (if any) with token cost notes\n   - Agent HQ usage instructions\n   - Secret requirements (names only, never values)\n   - Troubleshooting common issues\n2. This file MUST serve double duty:\n   - Instructions for Claude Code when running via CLI or GitHub Actions\n   - Context for GitHub Agent HQ when running via issue assignment\n\n**Failure mode**: If unsure about MCP requirements, list all possible MCPs with notes on which are required vs. optional.\n\n---\n\n## Step 8: Test (3-Level Validation Gates)\n\nValidate the generated system through three progressive levels. **Each level must pass before proceeding to the next.** Do not skip levels. Do not proceed past a failing gate.\n\n### Level 1: Syntax & Structure\n\nVerify every generated file is syntactically valid and structurally correct.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/test_tools.py` in syntax-only mode against each generated tool\n2. For each Python tool file:\n   - **AST parse**: Verify the file is valid Python (`python -c \"import ast; ast.parse(open('{tool}').read())\"`)\n   - **Import check**: Verify the file imports without errors (`python -c \"import importlib; importlib.import_module('{tool_module}')\"`)\n   - **Structure check**: Verify `main()` exists and is callable\n   - **Docstring check**: Verify module-level docstring exists\n   - **Error handling check**: Verify at least one `try/except` block exists (AST inspection)\n3. For each workflow/markdown file:\n   - Verify it is non-empty\n   - Verify it has required sections (Inputs, Outputs for workflow.md)\n4. For each YAML file (.github/workflows/):\n   - Verify valid YAML syntax\n   - Verify `timeout-minutes` is set on every job\n5. For each subagent file (.claude/agents/):\n   - Verify YAML frontmatter parses correctly\n   - Verify required fields (`name`, `description`) are present\n   - Verify `name` is lowercase-with-hyphens only\n   - Verify system prompt body is non-empty\n6. Log all Level 1 results\n\n**Gate**: ALL files must pass Level 1. If any file fails:\n- Attempt automatic fix (syntax errors, missing docstrings, missing main())\n- Re-run Level 1 on the fixed files\n- If auto-fix fails after 2 attempts, log the failure and halt the build\n\n**Failure mode**: If the testing infrastructure itself fails, generate a manual Level 1 checklist in README.md and proceed to Level 2 with a warning.\n\n### Level 2: Unit Tests\n\nVerify each tool produces correct output for sample inputs.\n\n1. For each Python tool:\n   - Run with sample/mock inputs: `python tools/{tool_name}.py --help` (verify argparse works)\n   - Run with minimal valid input and verify:\n     - Exit code is 0 on success\n     - Output is valid JSON (if tool outputs JSON)\n     - Output contains expected keys/structure\n   - Run with invalid input and verify:\n     - Exit code is non-zero\n     - Error message is meaningful (not a raw traceback)\n     - The tool does not hang or crash silently\n2. For tools that call external APIs:\n   - Verify the tool handles missing API keys gracefully (clear error message, non-zero exit)\n   - If the PRP provides mock data, use it for testing\n   - If no mock data, verify the tool's error path (missing credentials) works correctly\n3. Verify `requirements.txt` contains all dependencies used by the tools\n4. Log all Level 2 results\n\n**Gate**: ALL tools must pass Level 2. If any tool fails:\n- Read the error output, identify the root cause\n- Fix the tool code (not the test)\n- Re-run Level 2 on the fixed tool\n- If fix fails after 2 attempts, log the failure and halt the build\n\n**Failure mode**: If external APIs are unreachable and no mock data exists, verify error handling paths only and document untested happy paths in README.md.\n\n### Level 3: Integration Tests\n\nVerify tools work together as a pipeline and the system is complete.\n\n1. **Pipeline test**: Simulate the workflow end-to-end with sample data\n   - Run tools in workflow order, passing each tool's output as the next tool's input\n   - Verify the final output matches expected format and contains expected data\n   - Verify no tool drops data or produces incompatible output for the next step\n2. **Cross-reference validation**:\n   - Verify workflow.md references only tools that exist in `tools/`\n   - Verify CLAUDE.md documents every tool, subagent, and secret\n   - Verify .github/workflows/ YAML references correct tool paths and secret names\n   - Verify .env.example lists every secret referenced in CLAUDE.md and GitHub Actions\n   - Verify README.md covers all three execution paths\n3. **Subagent integration**:\n   - Verify each subagent file in `.claude/agents/` is referenced in CLAUDE.md\n   - Verify subagent tool lists contain only valid Claude Code tools\n   - Verify subagent descriptions match the workflow phases they serve\n4. **Package completeness**:\n   - Verify all required system files exist (CLAUDE.md, workflow.md, tools/, .github/workflows/, requirements.txt, README.md, .env.example, .gitignore)\n   - Verify no hardcoded secrets in any file (scan for common patterns: `sk-`, `api_key=`, bearer tokens)\n5. Log all Level 3 results\n\n**Gate**: ALL integration checks must pass. If any fail:\n- Identify the inconsistency (e.g., workflow.md references a tool that does not exist)\n- Fix the source file\n- Re-run Level 3\n- If fix fails after 2 attempts, log the failure and halt the build\n\n**Failure mode**: If the full pipeline cannot be tested (e.g., requires live API access), test each tool independently with sample data and document the untested integration path in README.md.\n\n---\n\n## Step 9: Package\n\nBundle everything into a deployable system.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/package_system.py`\n2. Create the output directory: `systems/{system_name}/`\n3. Place all files:\n   - `CLAUDE.md` (from Step 7)\n   - `workflow.md` (from Step 4)\n   - `tools/` (from Step 5)\n   - `.claude/agents/` (from Step 5b)\n   - `.github/workflows/` (from Step 6)\n   - `requirements.txt` (from Step 5)\n4. Generate `README.md` with:\n   - System overview\n   - Setup instructions for ALL THREE execution paths:\n     - **(a) Claude Code CLI**: Clone repo, set env vars, run `claude` with workflow.md\n     - **(b) GitHub Actions dispatch**: Push to GitHub, configure secrets, trigger via Actions UI or API\n     - **(c) GitHub Agent HQ**: Assign issue to @claude with task description in issue body\n   - Required secrets list\n   - Example usage for each path\n5. Verify the package is complete: all required files present, no hardcoded secrets\n\n**Failure mode**: If any files are missing, log what's missing and package what exists with a TODO list in README.md.\n\n---\n\n## Step 10: Learn\n\nExtract learnings and update the factory's knowledge base.\n\n1. Review the system that was just built — what patterns were used?\n2. **Update `library/patterns.md`**:\n   - If a new pattern was discovered, add it with a description and example\n   - If an existing pattern was refined, update its entry\n3. **Update `library/tool_catalog.md`**:\n   - If new tool patterns were created, catalog them for reuse\n   - If existing tool patterns were improved, update their entries\n4. **If this was an n8n conversion**:\n   - Save the n8n-to-WAT mapping in `converters/n8n_examples/` for future reference\n5. Log what worked well and what was difficult — this informs future improvements\n6. Commit all library updates\n\n**Failure mode**: If learning extraction fails, the system build is still valid — learning is a bonus, not a requirement.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770819040088}}

Python scripts or inline Claude processing.\n5. **Output** -- Write results to a file in the repo (`data/`, `output/`), post to an API, or commit as a structured artifact.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP** -- lightweight HTTP retrieval, returns Markdown-converted content.\n- **Puppeteer / Playwright MCP** -- for JavaScript-rendered pages requiring a headless browser.\n- **Python** -- pandas, BeautifulSoup, or custom scripts for heavy transformation.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- write results to disk.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 6 * * *'   # daily at 06:00 UTC\n  workflow_dispatch:        # manual trigger\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Scrape competitor pricing pages nightly; output a CSV diff showing changes.\n- Collect job postings from three sites; normalize into a single JSON feed committed to the repo.\n- Pull public government data tables and convert to machine-readable Parquet files.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Retry with backoff** on transient HTTP errors (429, 503).\n- **Schema validation** after extraction -- if required fields are missing, flag the record rather than silently dropping it.\n- **Stale-data guard** -- if fetch returns identical content to last run, skip processing and log \"no change.\"\n- **Alert on structural change** -- if selectors return zero matches (site redesign), open a GitHub Issue for human review.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Research > Analyze > Report\n\n**Summary:** A multi-source research workflow that gathers information from diverse sources (web, APIs, local files), synthesizes findings with Claude, and produces a formatted report committed to the repository.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need to compile information from multiple sources into a single coherent document.\n- Periodic market research, competitive analysis, or literature reviews.\n- Any task where a human would spend hours reading and summarizing.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Define research brief** -- Specify the topic, questions to answer, source priorities, and output format.\n2. **Gather sources** -- Query web search, fetch specific URLs, read local reference files, call APIs.\n3. **Extract key findings** -- For each source, pull relevant facts, quotes, data points. Tag each with provenance.\n4. **Analyze and synthesize** -- Claude cross-references findings, identifies patterns, contradictions, and gaps.\n5. **Generate report** -- Produce a structured Markdown document with sections, citations, and an executive summary.\n6. **Commit and notify** -- Commit the report to the repo. Optionally open a PR or send a notification.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Web Search MCP / Fetch MCP** -- gather online sources.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read local reference documents.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit output, open issues or PRs.\n- **Claude (extended thinking)** -- deep analysis and synthesis.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'   # weekly on Monday at 09:00 UTC\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      topic:\n        description: 'Research topic'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Weekly competitive landscape report that tracks new features announced by three competitors.\n- Monthly technology radar summarizing emerging tools relevant to the team's stack.\n- Ad-hoc deep-dive report triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch` with a topic input.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Source fallback** -- if a primary source is unreachable, log it and proceed with remaining sources. Note gaps in the report.\n- **Confidence scoring** -- Claude flags low-confidence claims; the report includes a \"Caveats\" section.\n- **Minimum-source threshold** -- if fewer than N sources are successfully retrieved, abort and open an issue rather than publishing a thin report.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Monitor > Detect > Alert\n\n**Summary:** A continuous monitoring system that periodically checks a target (website, API, dataset, repo) for changes, applies detection logic, and fires alerts or triggers downstream workflows when significant changes are found.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want to be notified when something changes: a webpage, an API response, a competitor's pricing, a regulatory filing.\n- You need a lightweight, Git-native alternative to commercial monitoring SaaS.\n- Ideal for cron-triggered GitHub Actions that run on a schedule.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Fetch current state** -- Retrieve the current snapshot of the monitored target.\n2. **Load previous state** -- Read the last-known state from a file committed in the repo (e.g., `state/last_snapshot.json`).\n3. **Diff** -- Compare current vs. previous. Use structural diff for JSON, text diff for prose, hash comparison for binary.\n4. **Evaluate significance** -- Apply rules or Claude-based judgment to determine if the change is meaningful (filter noise).\n5. **Alert** -- If significant: open a GitHub Issue, send a Slack message, trigger a downstream workflow via `repository_dispatch`, or all three.\n6. **Persist new state** -- Commit the current snapshot as the new baseline.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP / Puppeteer MCP** -- retrieve current state from web targets.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write state files.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- open issues, trigger dispatches.\n- **Slack MCP** -- send alert messages.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '*/30 * * * *'  # every 30 minutes\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Monitor a government regulatory page for new filings; alert the legal team via Slack when a new document appears.\n- Watch a competitor's changelog page; open a GitHub Issue summarizing each detected update.\n- Track an API's response schema for breaking changes; alert the engineering team.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Transient failure tolerance** -- if the fetch fails, do NOT overwrite previous state. Log the failure. After N consecutive failures, escalate to an alert.\n- **False-positive suppression** -- use Claude to evaluate whether a detected \"change\" is meaningful (e.g., ignore timestamp-only diffs).\n- **State corruption recovery** -- if state file is missing or unparseable, re-initialize from scratch and log a warning instead of crashing.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Intake > Enrich > Deliver\n\n**Summary:** A data enrichment pipeline that receives raw input (from a form, webhook, file drop, or API), augments it with additional data from external sources, and delivers the enriched result to its destination.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- Incoming data is incomplete and needs augmentation before it is useful.\n- You are building a lead enrichment, content tagging, or metadata enhancement system.\n- Raw data arrives in one format and must be transformed and enriched before storage or delivery.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Intake** -- Receive raw data. Sources: webhook payload, new file in repo, manual trigger with JSON input, or a watched directory.\n2. **Validate** -- Check that required fields exist and data types are correct. Reject malformed input early.\n3. **Enrich** -- For each record, call enrichment sources: web search for context, APIs for supplementary data, Claude for classification or summarization.\n4. **Merge** -- Combine original data with enrichment results into a unified schema.\n5. **Deliver** -- Write enriched data to its destination: commit to repo, POST to API, append to a dataset file, or open a PR.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Web Search MCP** -- find supplementary information.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- call enrichment APIs.\n- **Claude** -- classify, tag, summarize, or score records.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read input, write output.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit results or open PRs.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'inbox/**'          # new file dropped in inbox\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      payload:\n        description: 'JSON data to enrich'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- A sales team drops a CSV of company names into `inbox/`; the pipeline enriches each with industry, size, website, and LinkedIn URL, then writes to `data/enriched_leads.csv`.\n- Incoming support tickets are enriched with customer history and sentiment score before routing.\n- Raw RSS feed items are enriched with summaries, topic tags, and relevance scores.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Per-record error isolation** -- if enrichment fails for one record, mark it as `enrichment_failed` and continue processing the rest. Do not let one bad record kill the batch.\n- **Rate-limit awareness** -- track API call counts; pause and retry when rate-limited rather than failing fast.\n- **Partial delivery** -- deliver successfully enriched records on schedule; queue failed records for retry in the next run.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Generate > Review > Publish\n\n**Summary:** A content generation pipeline with built-in quality gates. Claude generates draft content, a review step validates quality and compliance, and approved content is published to its destination.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- Automated content creation (blog posts, documentation, social media, release notes) where quality must be verified before publishing.\n- Any workflow where you want a \"human-in-the-loop\" approval step or an automated quality check before output goes live.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Brief** -- Define the content requirements: topic, audience, tone, length, format, and any reference material.\n2. **Generate** -- Claude produces a first draft using the brief and any provided reference material.\n3. **Automated review** -- Run quality checks: spelling/grammar, factual consistency against source material, tone analysis, compliance rules (e.g., no prohibited claims).\n4. **Gate decision** -- If automated review passes, proceed. If it fails, loop back to step 2 with feedback (max N retries). Optionally, require human approval via a PR review.\n5. **Publish** -- Commit final content to the repo, deploy to a CMS via API, or post to a platform.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Claude** -- generation and review (use separate system prompts for generator vs. reviewer to create genuine separation).\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read briefs, write drafts and final output.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- open a draft PR for human review; merge on approval.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- publish to external CMS or platform APIs.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [labeled]        # label \"content-request\" triggers generation\n  pull_request_review:\n    types: [submitted]      # human approval triggers publish\n  workflow_dispatch:\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Weekly changelog: gather merged PRs, generate a formatted changelog, open a PR for team review, publish on approval.\n- Blog post pipeline: issue labeled \"draft-request\" triggers generation; editor reviews the PR; merge triggers deployment.\n- Social media batch: generate a week's worth of posts, run brand-voice review, output approved posts to a scheduling queue.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Retry budget** -- if automated review rejects the draft, regenerate with targeted feedback up to 3 times. After that, escalate to a human by opening an issue.\n- **Rollback on publish failure** -- if the publish step fails (API error), keep the approved content in the repo and log the failure for manual retry.\n- **Diff guard** -- before publishing, diff against previously published content to prevent accidental overwrite of manual edits.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Listen > Decide > Act\n\n**Summary:** An event-driven agent that listens for incoming events (webhooks, GitHub events, messages), applies decision logic to determine the appropriate response, and takes autonomous action.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need a system that reacts to external events in near-real-time.\n- Webhook-triggered GitHub Actions are the execution engine.\n- The appropriate response depends on the content of the event (routing, triage, conditional logic).\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Receive event** -- GitHub Actions triggers on the event (webhook, issue creation, PR comment, `repository_dispatch`).\n2. **Parse and classify** -- Extract relevant data from the event payload. Use Claude to classify intent or severity if the input is unstructured (e.g., natural language).\n3. **Decide** -- Apply decision logic: rule-based routing, Claude-driven triage, or a lookup table. Determine which action(s) to take.\n4. **Act** -- Execute the chosen action: respond to the issue, trigger another workflow, call an API, update a file, or escalate to a human.\n5. **Log** -- Record the event, decision, and action taken for auditability.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **GitHub MCP** -- read event payloads, respond to issues/PRs, trigger dispatches.\n- **Claude** -- classify, triage, and decide.\n- **Slack MCP** -- notify humans when escalation is needed.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- call external APIs as part of the action.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened, labeled]\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [incoming_webhook]\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Triage bot: new issues are classified by Claude (bug, feature, question) and auto-labeled, assigned, and replied to with relevant templates.\n- Deployment gatekeeper: a PR comment like \"/deploy staging\" triggers a deployment workflow after validating the commenter's permissions.\n- Customer feedback router: webhook delivers feedback; Claude scores sentiment and routes critical items to Slack.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Idempotency** -- design actions to be safe to retry. Use event IDs to detect and skip duplicate deliveries.\n- **Decision logging** -- log the full decision chain (event > classification > decision > action) so failures can be diagnosed.\n- **Safe defaults** -- if classification confidence is low, default to escalation (notify a human) rather than taking an autonomous action that might be wrong.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Collect > Transform > Store\n\n**Summary:** A classic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline where Git serves as the data store. Data is collected from external sources, transformed into a canonical format, and committed to the repository as versioned, queryable files.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want a version-controlled data lake without standing up a database.\n- Small-to-medium datasets (tens of MB) that benefit from Git's diff, history, and branching.\n- Data pipelines where auditability and reproducibility matter more than query speed.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Collect** -- Pull data from source(s): APIs, web scrapes, file uploads, other repos.\n2. **Validate** -- Check data integrity: schema validation, null checks, type enforcement.\n3. **Transform** -- Normalize, clean, reshape. Convert to the canonical schema. Deduplicate against existing data in the store.\n4. **Diff** -- Compare transformed data against the current version in the repo. Compute what is new, changed, or deleted.\n5. **Store** -- Commit the updated dataset files to the repo. Use meaningful commit messages describing what changed (e.g., \"Add 14 new records from source X\").\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP** -- pull data from APIs and web sources.\n- **Python** -- pandas or custom scripts for transformation.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write data files.\n- **GitHub MCP / Git CLI** -- commit, push, branch as needed.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # every 6 hours\n  workflow_dispatch:\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Collect cryptocurrency prices from three APIs every 6 hours; store as daily CSV files in `data/prices/`.\n- Pull open government datasets weekly; transform into a normalized schema; maintain a living dataset in the repo.\n- Aggregate internal metrics from multiple microservice health endpoints; store as JSON for a dashboard.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Atomic commits** -- only commit if the entire pipeline succeeds. Never commit partial or corrupted data.\n- **Schema drift detection** -- if source data no longer matches the expected schema, abort and alert rather than storing malformed data.\n- **Rollback via Git** -- if bad data is committed, revert the commit. The previous state is always recoverable.\n- **Dedup safety** -- idempotent writes ensure that re-running the pipeline does not create duplicate records.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Fan-Out > Process > Merge\n\n**Summary:** The Agent Teams pattern. A coordinator agent splits a large task into independent sub-tasks, dispatches them to parallel sub-agents (or sequential iterations), collects all results, and merges them into a unified output.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- A task is naturally decomposable into independent units of work (e.g., process each file, research each topic, analyze each competitor).\n- You want to reduce wall-clock time by parallelizing work.\n- The final deliverable requires combining results from multiple sub-tasks.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Plan** -- The coordinator analyzes the task and determines how to decompose it. Produces a work manifest: a list of sub-tasks with their inputs.\n2. **Fan-Out** -- Dispatch each sub-task. Options: parallel GitHub Actions jobs via a matrix strategy, sequential Claude tool calls, or `repository_dispatch` events to separate workflows.\n3. **Process** -- Each sub-agent executes its sub-task independently. Results are written to a known location (e.g., `temp/results/task_01.json`).\n4. **Collect** -- The coordinator waits for all sub-tasks to complete and gathers their outputs.\n5. **Merge** -- Combine results: concatenate, deduplicate, reconcile conflicts, and produce the final unified output.\n6. **Deliver** -- Commit the merged output or pass it to the next stage in a larger pipeline.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Claude** -- coordinator logic, sub-task execution, merge logic.\n- **GitHub Actions matrix** -- parallel job execution.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write intermediate and final results.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- coordinate via issues, artifacts, or dispatch events.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      task_manifest:\n        description: 'JSON array of sub-tasks'\n        required: true\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [fan_out_request]\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Analyze 20 competitor websites: fan out one sub-agent per competitor, each produces a profile, merge into a single competitive analysis report.\n- Process a batch of 50 documents: each sub-agent summarizes one document, merge into a master summary with cross-references.\n- Multi-language translation: fan out one sub-agent per target language, merge all translations into a localized content bundle.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Partial success tolerance** -- if some sub-tasks fail, merge the successful results and report failures. Do not discard all work because of one failure.\n- **Retry failed sub-tasks** -- the coordinator can re-dispatch failed sub-tasks up to N times before giving up.\n- **Timeout enforcement** -- set a maximum wall-clock time for the fan-out phase. Collect whatever is done when the timer expires.\n- **Conflict resolution** -- if sub-task results conflict, the merge step uses Claude to reconcile or flags the conflict for human review.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Issue > Execute > PR\n\n**Summary:** The GitHub Agent HQ pattern. An agent receives a task specification via a GitHub Issue, autonomously executes the required workflow, and delivers the results as a draft Pull Request for human review.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want a human-in-the-loop task queue where work is requested via Issues and delivered via PRs.\n- The agent should be fully autonomous in execution but the output requires human approval before merging.\n- Building an internal tool where non-technical stakeholders can request work by opening an Issue.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Receive** -- A new Issue is opened (or an existing Issue is labeled with a trigger label like `agent-task`). GitHub Actions fires.\n2. **Parse task** -- Claude reads the Issue body and extracts the task specification: what to do, inputs, constraints, expected output.\n3. **Create branch** -- Create a feature branch named after the Issue (e.g., `agent/issue-42`).\n4. **Execute** -- Run the appropriate workflow or pattern to complete the task. This might invoke any other pattern in this catalog.\n5. **Commit results** -- Commit all output files to the feature branch with clear commit messages.\n6. **Open draft PR** -- Open a draft PR linked to the original Issue. The PR body includes a summary of what was done, key decisions made, and anything that needs human attention.\n7. **Comment on Issue** -- Post a comment on the Issue linking to the PR and summarizing the outcome.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **GitHub MCP** -- read issues, create branches, commit, open PRs, post comments.\n- **Claude** -- parse task, execute logic, generate summaries.\n- **Any other MCP** -- depending on the task being executed.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened, labeled]\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]       # support \"/execute\" command in comments\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- A product manager opens an Issue: \"Research top 5 CRM tools and compare features.\" The agent researches, builds a comparison table, and opens a PR with the report.\n- An engineer opens an Issue: \"Add unit tests for the auth module.\" The agent generates tests and delivers them as a PR.\n- A stakeholder opens an Issue: \"Update the pricing page data for Q1.\" The agent pulls new data, updates the files, and opens a PR for review.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Status updates** -- the agent comments on the Issue at each major step (\"Starting research...\", \"Generating report...\", \"Opening PR...\") so progress is visible.\n- **Graceful failure** -- if the agent cannot complete the task, it comments on the Issue with a clear explanation of what went wrong and what it tried, then labels the Issue `agent-failed` for human triage.\n- **Scope guard** -- if Claude determines the task is ambiguous or out of scope, it asks a clarifying question in the Issue comments rather than guessing.\n- **Draft-only PRs** -- all PRs are opened as drafts. The agent never merges its own work.\n\n---\n\n## 10. n8n Import > Translate > Deploy\n\n**Summary:** A conversion pattern that ingests an n8n workflow JSON export, translates it into a WAT-native system (Claude Code + MCP + GitHub Actions), and deploys it as a fully functional GitHub-native workflow.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You are migrating from n8n (or a similar visual workflow tool) to a GitHub-native architecture.\n- You want to leverage existing workflow logic without manually rewriting it.\n- You are evaluating whether an n8n workflow can run as a WAT system to reduce infrastructure dependencies.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Import** -- Read the n8n workflow JSON file. This contains nodes, connections, credentials references, and configuration.\n2. **Parse and map** -- Walk the node graph. For each n8n node type, identify the equivalent WAT component:\n   - HTTP Request node -> Fetch MCP call\n   - Code (JavaScript/Python) node -> inline script or Python file\n   - IF/Switch node -> Claude decision logic or conditional in workflow\n   - Webhook trigger -> `repository_dispatch` or `workflow_dispatch`\n   - Cron trigger -> `schedule` trigger in GitHub Actions\n   - Set/Merge nodes -> data transformation in Claude or Python\n3. **Translate** -- Generate the WAT system files:\n   - `.github/workflows/*.yml` -- GitHub Actions workflow definition.\n   - `prompts/` -- Claude system prompts for nodes that require AI logic.\n   - `scripts/` -- Python or shell scripts for code nodes.\n   - `config/` -- Configuration extracted from the n8n workflow.\n4. **Validate** -- Dry-run the generated workflow. Check that all node types were mapped, no credentials are hardcoded, and the control flow is correct.\n5. **Deploy** -- Commit the generated files to the repo. Open a PR with a detailed summary of the translation, noting any nodes that required manual review or could not be auto-translated.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read n8n JSON, write generated files.\n- **Claude** -- interpret node logic, generate prompts, translate code, produce workflow YAML.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit files, open PR.\n- **Python** -- parse n8n JSON, generate boilerplate.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'imports/n8n/*.json'   # drop an n8n export to trigger conversion\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      n8n_file:\n        description: 'Path to n8n JSON file in the repo'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Migrate a 15-node n8n lead-scoring workflow to a Git-versioned, GitHub Actions-powered system.\n- Convert an n8n social media posting pipeline into a WAT **Generate > Review > Publish** system.\n- Translate an n8n monitoring workflow into a WAT **Monitor > Detect > Alert** pattern, eliminating the need for a running n8n instance.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Unsupported node catalog** -- maintain a list of n8n node types that cannot be auto-translated. When encountered, flag them in the PR description with a `TODO` and a suggested manual implementation.\n- **Credential safety** -- never translate credentials. Replace all credential references with GitHub Secrets placeholders (`${{ secrets.SERVICE_API_KEY }}`) and document which secrets need to be configured.\n- **Fidelity check** -- generate a side-by-side comparison of the n8n flow and the translated WAT flow so a human reviewer can verify correctness.\n- **Incremental migration** -- support translating a subset of the n8n workflow, allowing teams to migrate node-by-node rather than all-at-once.\n\n---\n\n## Pattern Composition Quick Reference\n\nPatterns are building blocks. Here are common compositions:\n\n| Composition | How It Works |\n|---|---|\n| **Monitor > Detect > Alert** + **Issue > Execute > PR** | Monitor detects a change, opens an Issue, which triggers the agent to act and deliver a PR. |\n| **Issue > Execute > PR** using **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** | A complex Issue task is decomposed and parallelized internally before the PR is opened. |\n| **Scrape > Process > Output** feeding **Collect > Transform > Store** | Scraping output is piped into the ETL pattern for versioned storage. |\n| **Listen > Decide > Act** routing to any pattern | An event-driven dispatcher that selects and triggers the appropriate pattern based on the event. |\n| **n8n Import > Translate > Deploy** producing any pattern | The translator identifies which WAT pattern best fits the n8n workflow and generates accordingly. |\n\n---\n\n## Choosing a Pattern\n\n| Question | Recommended Pattern |\n|---|---|\n| Do I need to pull data from websites? | **Scrape > Process > Output** |\n| Do I need to synthesize information from many sources? | **Research > Analyze > Report** |\n| Do I need to watch for changes over time? | **Monitor > Detect > Alert** |\n| Do I need to augment incoming data? | **Intake > Enrich > Deliver** |\n| Do I need AI-generated content with quality control? | **Generate > Review > Publish** |\n| Do I need to react to external events? | **Listen > Decide > Act** |\n| Do I need versioned data storage without a database? | **Collect > Transform > Store** |\n| Do I need to parallelize a large task? | **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** |\n| Do I need a task queue with human approval? | **Issue > Execute > PR** |\n| Do I need to migrate an n8n workflow? | **n8n Import > Translate > Deploy** |\n| Do I need B2B lead generation from web data? | **Intake > Enrich > Deliver** (lead-gen variant) |\n\n---\n\n## Proven Compositions (from builds)\n\n### Lead Generation Pipeline (lead-gen-machine)\n- **Pattern**: Intake > Enrich > Deliver + Scrape > Process > Output\n- **Flow**: Parse profile > Search web > Scrape sites > Extract contacts (Claude) > Score leads > Output CSV\n- **Key insight**: The Intake > Enrich > Deliver pattern works well when the \"enrichment\" involves multi-step web scraping + AI extraction. Each company is an independent unit of work, making this a strong candidate for Fan-Out > Process > Merge parallelization.\n- **Scoring pattern**: Decompose match criteria into independent dimensions (industry, size, location, keywords) with weighted point values. This makes the scoring transparent and tunable.\n- **Fallback chains**: Firecrawl > HTTP+BeautifulSoup for scraping, Claude > regex for extraction. Always have a degraded-but-functional fallback.\n\n### Marketing Pipeline (marketing-pipeline)\n- **Pattern**: Intake > Enrich > Deliver + Generate > Review > Publish\n- **Flow**: Ingest CSV > Enrich via Apollo/Hunter/Brave/Claude > Deep-score (5 dimensions) > Segment (Hot/Warm/Cold) > Generate outreach (Hot) > Generate nurture (Warm) > Output CSVs + emails\n- **Key insight**: Multi-API enrichment with graceful degradation. Apollo (primary) > Hunter (email verification) > Brave (research) > Claude (pain analysis). Each API layer adds value but the system works with only Anthropic API.\n- **Scoring pattern**: 5-dimension scoring (size fit, tech stack compatibility, budget signals, accessibility, pain signals) with transparent point breakdown. More dimensions = more nuanced than lead-gen-machine's 4-dimension approach.\n- **Content generation pattern**: Outreach and nurture are independent post-segmentation, making them natural Agent Teams candidates. Outreach is per-lead personalized; nurture is aggregate-informed.\n- **API fallback chain**: Apollo > Hunter > Brave > Claude > HTTP scraping. Four-level fallback with clear degradation at each level.\n- **CSV-in/CSV-out**: Accepts CSV input (compatible with lead-gen-machine output), produces segmented CSVs + markdown email sequences. Easy to chain systems.\n\n### Website Uptime Monitor (website-uptime-monitor)\n- **Pattern**: Monitor > Log (simplified from Monitor > Detect > Alert)\n- **Flow**: Check URL via HTTP GET > Measure response time > Determine up/down status > Append to CSV > Commit to Git\n- **Key insight**: Simplest possible monitoring system - no detection logic, no alerting, just raw data collection. Every check produces a log entry regardless of status. Git history IS the audit trail.\n- **No MCPs needed**: Direct Python `requests` library is simpler and more reliable than Fetch MCP for a single GET request. CSV append uses stdlib. Zero external dependencies beyond GitHub Actions.\n- **Exit code signaling**: Tool exits 0 if up, 1 if down - GitHub Actions UI shows workflow as \"failed\" when site is down, providing at-a-glance status without additional alerting logic.\n- **Concurrency handling**: GitHub Actions `concurrency` setting prevents simultaneous runs. Git push includes retry with rebase to handle rare concurrent commits.\n- **CSV as database**: Append-only CSV committed to Git provides versioned, auditable, queryable dataset. No external database needed. Git handles MB-scale data easily.\n- **Cron variance accepted**: GitHub Actions cron has ±5 minute variance - documented as expected behavior rather than a bug to fix.\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) Scheduled cron (primary), (2) Manual dispatch (testing), (3) Local CLI (development). Agent HQ (4) optional for issue-driven tasks.\n- **Cost awareness**: ~1,440 GitHub Actions minutes/month for 5-minute checks. Fits within free tier (2,000/month private, unlimited public).\n- **Extensibility points**: Add alerting by extending monitor.yml (Slack webhook, GitHub Issue). Add multiple URLs via matrix strategy or separate workflows. Add authentication via tool arguments + GitHub Secrets.\n\n### CSV-to-JSON Converter (csv-to-json-converter)\n- **Pattern**: Collect > Transform > Store\n- **Flow**: Collect CSV files > Analyze structure > Parse CSV > Infer types > Validate data > Convert to JSON/JSONL > Generate reports > Commit\n- **Key insight**: Multi-phase transformation with specialist subagents. Each phase (analyze, infer, validate, write) has a dedicated subagent with focused responsibilities. Main agent orchestrates the pipeline.\n- **Subagent architecture**: Four specialist subagents (csv-analyzer, type-inference-specialist, data-validator, json-writer) with minimal tool access. Subagents are the DEFAULT delegation mechanism, not Agent Teams.\n- **Type inference pattern**: Statistical analysis with confidence scoring (80% threshold). Detects int, float, boolean, datetime, string. Falls back to string for ambiguous columns. Handles 10+ null value representations.\n- **Encoding detection**: chardet for automatic encoding detection with UTF-8 fallback. Strips BOM (byte order mark) automatically. Supports UTF-8, Latin-1, Windows-1252, etc.\n- **Ragged row handling**: Pad short rows with null, truncate long rows with warning. Log all issues in validation report but continue processing (graceful degradation).\n- **Validation without failure**: Validator NEVER raises exceptions. Always returns a report. Strict mode controls whether issues halt the pipeline, but validation itself is fail-safe.\n- **JSONL streaming**: For large files (1M+ rows), JSONL format writes one record at a time. No array wrapper. Memory-efficient for multi-GB datasets.\n- **Batch processing modes**: Sequential (1-2 files) or parallel (3+ files with Agent Teams). Parallel is 5x faster wall time but same token cost. Always has sequential fallback.\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) CLI for local development, (2) GitHub Actions for production, (3) Agent HQ for issue-driven tasks. All three produce identical output.\n- **Metadata reporting**: run_summary.json (machine-readable) + validation_report.md (human-readable). Includes per-file stats, type inference results, validation issues, recommendations.\n- **No secrets required**: Uses only stdlib (csv, json, pathlib) + chardet + python-dateutil. No external APIs. Pure data transformation pipeline.\n- **Git commit discipline**: Stage ONLY output files (never `git add -A`). Commit message includes file count, row count, timestamp. Output directory is parameterized.\n\n### RSS Digest Monitor (rss-digest-monitor)\n- **Pattern**: Monitor > Collect > Transform > Deliver (with state persistence)\n- **Flow**: Load state > Fetch RSS feeds > Filter new posts > Generate HTML digest > Send email > Update state > Commit\n- **Key insight**: State persistence in Git prevents post duplication across runs. Composite GUID keys (feed_url::guid) prevent false deduplication. State is ONLY updated after successful email delivery, ensuring retry on failure.\n- **Subagent architecture**: Three specialist subagents (rss-fetcher-specialist, digest-generator-specialist, state-manager-specialist). Subagents are the DEFAULT delegation mechanism. Sequential execution is correct due to clear data dependencies.\n- **Per-feed error isolation**: One failed feed does NOT kill the entire run. Each feed is fetched independently with try/except. Failed feeds are logged and skipped. Graceful degradation ensures partial success.\n- **Composite GUID pattern**: Use `feed_url::entry_guid` as deduplication key instead of guid alone. Prevents false positives when different feeds use the same GUID format.\n- **State file size management**: Enforce maximum 10,000 GUIDs by keeping most recent entries. Prevents unbounded state growth. Log warning if limit is hit.\n- **Email with fallback**: MIME multipart with HTML primary and plain-text fallback. Ensures compatibility with all email clients. HTML is styled with inline CSS for maximum rendering support.\n- **Conditional email send**: Skip email generation if no new posts found. Silent run with state update only. Saves API calls and prevents empty emails.\n- **SMTP retry logic**: Retry once with 30s delay on transient failures (auth, network, timeout). Do NOT update state if email send fails -- posts retry on next run.\n- **First-run initialization**: Missing or corrupted state file initializes empty state. All posts are processed on first run. Log warning but continue (better to duplicate once than crash).\n- **Date parsing with fallback**: Use python-dateutil for robust parsing of varied date formats. If unparseable, use current timestamp. Include post anyway (better to duplicate than miss).\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) Scheduled cron at 8 AM UTC (primary), (2) Manual dispatch with force_send (testing), (3) Local CLI (development). All produce identical output.\n- **Run summary logging**: Each run produces `logs/YYYY-MM-DD_run.json` with feeds_checked, feeds_failed, new_posts, email_sent, failed_feeds array. Machine-readable audit trail.\n- **Git commit discipline**: Stage ONLY state/rss_state.json and logs/*.json. NEVER `git add -A`. Commit message includes date and post count for easy history review.\n- **No MCP dependencies**: Uses standard Python libraries (feedparser, smtplib, json, pathlib). Works out-of-the-box with only Python and requirements.txt. No external MCPs required.\n- **Cost awareness**: ~3-5 minutes per day = ~90-150 GitHub Actions minutes/month. Well within free tier (2,000/month private, unlimited public). Minimal token cost for state management only.\n\n## 11. Content Transformation with Tone Matching\n\n**Summary:** An AI-powered content repurposing pipeline that extracts content from a source URL, analyzes its tone and style, and generates platform-optimized variants (social media, email, etc.) that match the source tone automatically.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need to publish the same content across multiple platforms with different format requirements\n- Content must maintain consistent voice/tone across all platforms\n- Manual reformatting for each platform is time-consuming and error-prone\n- You want AI to handle platform-specific best practices (character limits, hashtags, formatting)\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Fetch source content** -- Scrape the source URL (blog post, article) and extract clean text/markdown. Use Firecrawl with HTTP fallback for reliability.\n2. **Analyze tone** -- Use LLM (Claude) with structured output to analyze writing style across multiple dimensions: formality, technical level, humor, primary emotion. Return confidence score.\n3. **Generate platform variants (parallel)** -- For each target platform (Twitter, LinkedIn, email, Instagram):\n   - Send source content + tone analysis to LLM\n   - Request platform-optimized output matching source tone\n   - Enforce platform-specific constraints (char limits, hashtag counts, formatting rules)\n   - Validate character counts before accepting output\n4. **Merge and output** -- Combine all variants into single JSON file with metadata, tone analysis, and all platform content\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Firecrawl MCP** -- reliable web scraping with JS rendering support\n- **Anthropic MCP** -- Claude for tone analysis and content generation\n- **HTTP + BeautifulSoup** -- fallback scraping if Firecrawl unavailable\n- **Python stdlib** -- JSON manipulation, filename slugification, output assembly\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      blog_url:\n        description: 'Blog post URL to repurpose'\n        required: true\n  # Can also be triggered on new blog post detection via RSS or webhook\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Marketing team publishes a blog post, wants Twitter thread, LinkedIn post, email newsletter section, and Instagram caption\n- Content creator wants to maximize reach by publishing same content on all major platforms\n- Agency needs to repurpose client blog posts for multi-channel campaigns\n- Developer advocates want to turn technical blog posts into social-friendly content\n\n### Subagent Architecture\n\n- **content-scraper-specialist** -- Handles web scraping with fallback strategies\n- **tone-analyzer-specialist** -- Analyzes source content tone/style\n- **content-generator-specialist** -- Coordinates multi-platform generation (can use Agent Teams for parallelization)\n- **output-assembler-specialist** -- Merges all content into final JSON\n\n### Agent Teams Parallelization\n\nPlatform generation is ideal for Agent Teams:\n- 4 independent platform generation tasks (Twitter, LinkedIn, email, Instagram)\n- Each takes 10-15 seconds sequentially = 40-55s total\n- Parallel execution with 4 teammates = 12-18s\n- **2x speedup** with identical results and same token cost\n\n### Platform-Specific Constraints\n\n| Platform | Char Limit | Hashtags | Format Notes |\n|----------|------------|----------|--------------|\n| Twitter | 280 per tweet | 2-3 per thread | Numbered thread (1/N format), hook in first tweet, CTA in last |\n| LinkedIn | 3000 max, 1300 target | 3-5 | Professional tone, hook before \"see more\" fold, line breaks |\n| Email | 500-800 words | N/A | Subject line (40-60 chars), scannable format, HTML + plain text |\n| Instagram | 2200 max | 10-15 | Casual tone, emojis (3-5), line breaks, hook before \"more\" button |\n\n### Tone Matching Pattern\n\n1. LLM analyzes source content with structured JSON schema\n2. Returns tone profile: {formality, technical_level, humor_level, primary_emotion, confidence}\n3. Platform generators receive tone profile in their prompts\n4. Each generator adjusts output style to match source tone (formal → formal, casual → casual)\n5. Result: All platforms sound like they were written by the same person\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Scraping failure** -- Halt workflow immediately (no content = can't proceed). Log clear error about paywall/404/timeout.\n- **Tone analysis failure** -- Return default neutral profile, continue with warning. Quality slightly reduced but system remains functional.\n- **Single platform failure** -- Continue with other platforms. Include error structure for failed platform in output. Partial success is acceptable.\n- **Character limit exceeded** -- Tools automatically truncate with \"...\" and log warning. Better than crashing.\n\n### Performance & Cost\n\n**Execution time**:\n- Sequential: ~52-74 seconds\n- With Agent Teams: ~25-37 seconds (2x faster)\n\n**API cost per run** (Claude Sonnet 4):\n- Scraping: $0.01-0.02 (Firecrawl)\n- LLM calls: ~$0.09 (tone + 4 platforms)\n- **Total: ~$0.10-0.11 per blog post**\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n✅ Source content extracted (≥ 100 chars)\n✅ Tone analysis returns confidence ≥ 0.5\n✅ At least 2/4 platforms generate successfully\n✅ All character counts within platform limits\n✅ Output JSON file written to repo\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n- **Tone matching is powerful** -- AI can accurately replicate writing style when given structured tone analysis\n- **Parallel generation scales well** -- 4 independent LLM calls are perfect for Agent Teams\n- **Character validation is critical** -- Must validate before returning, not after\n- **Partial success is acceptable** -- 3/4 platforms working is better than all-or-nothing\n- **Firecrawl + fallback pattern works** -- Primary API with HTTP backup maximizes reliability\n- **Subagent specialization reduces complexity** -- Each subagent has clear, scoped responsibility\n\n### Related Patterns\n\nCombines elements of:\n- **Scrape > Process > Output** (content extraction)\n- **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** (parallel platform generation via Agent Teams)\n- **Generate > Review > Publish** (content creation with validation)\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770819040089}}

I've read all the necessary context files. Now I need to generate a PRP for the invoice-generator system based on the problem description. Let me break down what I understand:\n\n**Problem description:**\n- System takes JSON file input\n- Generates professional PDF invoices\n- Inputs: client name, project description, line items (quantities, rates), payment terms, due date\n- Output: Professional PDF with branding placeholders, itemized table, subtotal/tax/total, payment instructions\n- Saves to output/ directory with format: {client-name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{invoice-number}.pdf\n- Sequential invoice numbering via counter file\n- Configurable tax rate and payment methods\n- On-demand execution via command line\n\nLet me analyze what this system needs:\n\n1. **Pattern Selection**: This is a **Collect > Transform > Store** pattern. It takes input data, transforms it into a PDF, and stores the result in a predictable location with sequential numbering.\n\n2. **MCP/Tool Requirements**:\n   - No external APIs needed\n   - PDF generation via a Python library (e.g., ReportLab, WeasyPrint, or FPDF)\n   - File I/O for JSON input, counter file, and PDF output\n   - No web scraping, no AI processing\n\n3. **Subagent Architecture**:\n   - **invoice-parser-specialist**: Reads and validates JSON input\n   - **counter-manager-specialist**: Manages sequential invoice numbering\n   - **pdf-generator-specialist**: Generates the PDF invoice\n   - **output-handler-specialist**: Saves the PDF and updates counters\n\n4. **Agent Teams Analysis**: This is a sequential pipeline. Each step depends on the previous:\n   - Parse input → Get invoice number → Generate PDF → Save file\n   - **No parallelization opportunity**. Sequential execution is correct.\n\n5. **GitHub Actions Triggers**:\n   - Primary: `workflow_dispatch` with JSON input parameter\n   - Secondary: Could support file drop (push to `invoices/input/` directory)\n   - On-demand execution only, no scheduled runs needed\n\n6. **Tools Needed**:\n   - `parse_invoice_input.py` - Validates JSON input\n   - `manage_counter.py` - Reads/increments invoice counter\n   - `generate_invoice_pdf.py` - Creates PDF from data\n   - `save_invoice.py` - Writes PDF with proper naming\n\n7. **Confidence Score**: This is a straightforward, well-defined problem. The only potential ambiguity is \"branding placeholders\" -- but I can interpret that as config values.\n\nThe main uncertainty centers on how to handle customizable company name/logo/address fields, though this seems manageable. I'd rate this **8/10**.","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"I'll now generate a comprehensive PRP for the invoice-generator system.

The system runs autonomously via command line or GitHub Actions, saving invoices to a predictable output directory with standardized filenames.\n\n## Why\n- **Manual invoice creation is time-consuming**: Eliminates repetitive copy-paste work in document editors or spreadsheets\n- **Consistency matters**: Ensures every invoice follows the same professional format and structure\n- **Auditability is critical**: Sequential numbering and predictable filenames create a clear paper trail\n- **Automation saves money**: Reduces administrative overhead for freelancers, agencies, and small businesses\n- **Git-native versioning**: Committed invoices are version-controlled and recoverable\n\n## What\nThe system receives a JSON file containing invoice data (client details, line items, payment terms, due date), increments a persistent counter, calculates subtotal/tax/total, generates a professional PDF invoice with branding placeholders, and saves it to `output/` with filename format `{client-name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{invoice-number}.pdf`.\n\n### Success Criteria\n- [ ] Accepts valid JSON input via file path or workflow dispatch parameter\n- [ ] Validates all required fields (client name, project, line items, payment terms, due date)\n- [ ] Generates sequential invoice numbers via persistent counter file (survives restarts)\n- [ ] Calculates subtotal (sum of quantity × rate), applies configurable tax rate, produces correct total\n- [ ] Produces professional PDF with branding placeholders, itemized table, payment instructions\n- [ ] Saves PDF to `output/` directory with filename: `{client-name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{invoice-number}.pdf`\n- [ ] System runs autonomously via GitHub Actions on workflow dispatch\n- [ ] Results are committed back to repo\n- [ ] All three execution paths work: CLI, GitHub Actions, Agent HQ\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\nWhat goes into the system.

User may have different expectation. — Confidence: **medium**\n- [Concurrent execution]: GitHub Actions may trigger multiple workflows simultaneously. Counter locking handles this, but needs testing. — Confidence: **medium**\n- [Logo rendering]: ReportLab image handling can be finicky with different image formats. Graceful degradation needed. — Confidence: **medium**\n\n**Ambiguity flags** (areas requiring clarification before building):\n- [ ] **Branding placeholders**: Does \"branding placeholders\" mean (a) empty placeholder text fields in the PDF to be filled manually, OR (b) configurable company name/logo/address fields populated from config? **Assumption: (b) configurable fields.** If (a) is intended, tools need modification to render placeholder text instead of config values.\n\n**If any ambiguity flag is checked, DO NOT proceed to build. Ask the user to clarify first.**\n\n---\n\n## Factory Build Prompt\n\nWhen this PRP is ready, execute the build with:\n\n```\n/execute-prp PRPs/invoice-generator.md\n```\n\nThis will trigger `factory/workflow.md` with the above requirements as structured input.\n"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","usage":{"input":14,"output":11365,"cacheRead":8678,"cacheWrite":39314,"totalTokens":59371,"cost":{"input":0.000042000000000000004,"output":0.17047500000000002,"cacheRead":0.0026034,"cacheWrite":0.14742750000000002,"total":0.3205479}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1770819040094}}
