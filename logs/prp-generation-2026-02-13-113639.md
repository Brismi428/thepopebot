# PRP Generation Summary
**Date:** 2026-02-13T11:33:11Z
**System:** website-uptime-checker
**Confidence Score:** 9/10

## Problem Description
Monitor two specific websites (https://google.com and https://github.com) every 5 minutes to check if they're up or down. When a site goes down, send a Telegram message alert to the user. Log all check results (timestamps, status codes, response times) to a file for historical tracking.

## Analysis Results

### Pattern Selection
- **Primary Pattern:** Monitor > Log (simplified from Monitor > Detect > Alert)
- **Rationale:** System logs ALL checks (not just changes), creating full audit trail
- **Modification:** Append-only CSV logging, Git commit as persistence, alert is optional

### MCP Requirements
- **Telegram:** Primary for notifications, fallback to Bot API via HTTP
- **HTTP Requests:** Direct requests library (simpler than Fetch MCP for basic GET)
- **CSV Logging:** Python stdlib csv module (no MCP needed)
- **Git Operations:** git CLI via subprocess (standard in GitHub Actions)

### Subagent Architecture
1. **monitoring-specialist** - HTTP checks and response time measurement
2. **data-logger-specialist** - CSV file operations and log management
3. **alert-specialist** - Telegram notifications (optional)

### Agent Teams Analysis
- **Recommendation:** Sequential execution
- **Rationale:** Only 2 URLs (~2-4 seconds total), Agent Teams overhead not justified
- **Future:** Consider parallelization if URL list grows to 10+

### Tool Specifications
1. **monitor.py** - Check website availability, measure response time (pattern: rest_client)
2. **log_results.py** - Append results to CSV (pattern: csv_read_write)
3. **telegram_alert.py** - Send Telegram alerts (pattern: slack_notify adapted)

## Validation Approach

### Level 1: Syntax & Structure
- AST parse verification
- Import checks
- main() function validation

### Level 2: Unit Tests
- Test monitor.py with real URLs (google.com, github.com)
- Test log_results.py with sample JSON
- Test telegram_alert.py graceful skip without credentials

### Level 3: Integration Tests
- Full pipeline: check > log > verify CSV
- File existence validation
- CSV structure validation

## Confidence Score Breakdown

**9/10** - High confidence across all areas

**Strengths (+9):**
- Requirements are clear and specific
- Simple HTTP GET + CSV append pattern
- Well-documented tool patterns from catalog
- Executable validation with real URLs
- Minimal dependencies (only requests library)
- GitHub Actions cron is straightforward
- All edge cases covered (timeout, DNS, network)
- Complete fallback strategies

**Deductions (-1):**
- GitHub Actions cron has ±5 minute variance (documented limitation, not a bug)

**Ambiguity Flags:** None - all requirements resolved

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Sequential over Agent Teams**: 2 URLs don't justify parallelization overhead
2. **Direct requests over Fetch MCP**: Simpler, more reliable for basic GET
3. **CSV over database**: Git-versioned audit trail, no external dependencies
4. **Exit code signaling**: Tool exits 1 if any site down (GitHub Actions UI feedback)
5. **Optional Telegram**: System works without alerts, can add later
6. **Append-only logging**: Every check logged regardless of status (full history)

## Next Steps

To build this system, run:
```bash
/execute-prp PRPs/website-uptime-checker.md
```

This will trigger the WAT Systems Factory workflow to generate:
- Complete system in `systems/website-uptime-checker/`
- workflow.md with all steps and failure modes
- Three Python tools (monitor.py, log_results.py, telegram_alert.py)
- Three subagent definitions (.claude/agents/)
- GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/monitor.yml)
- Complete documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md)
- Validation scripts and tests
