Follow these steps to build a new WAT system from a problem description or n8n workflow JSON.\n\n## Inputs\n\n- **problem_description**: A natural language description of the system to build, OR an n8n workflow JSON file\n- **system_name**: A lowercase-with-dashes name for the new system\n- **enable_agent_teams**: Boolean — whether to use Agent Teams for parallelizable tasks (optional, default false)\n\n## Outputs\n\n- A complete WAT system in `systems/{system_name}/` containing:\n  - `CLAUDE.md` — operating instructions\n  - `workflow.md` — the system's process workflow\n  - `tools/` — Python tool files\n  - `.github/workflows/` — GitHub Actions workflow files\n  - `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies\n  - `README.md` — setup and usage instructions\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Intake\n\nReceive and classify the input.\n\n1. Read the `problem_description` input\n2. **Is this an n8n workflow JSON?**\n   - Check if the input is valid JSON containing n8n workflow structure (nodes, connections)\n   - **If yes**: Route to Step 1b (n8n Conversion)\n   - **If no**: Continue to Step 2 with the problem description as-is\n\n### Step 1b: n8n Conversion\n\nConvert an existing n8n workflow into WAT format.\n\n1. Parse the n8n JSON using `factory/tools/convert_n8n.py`\n2. Reference `converters/n8n_node_map.md` to translate every node type\n3. Map each n8n element:\n   - **Trigger nodes** (Webhook, Schedule, Manual) → GitHub Actions triggers\n   - **Action nodes** (HTTP Request, Function, etc.) → Python tools\n   - **Logic nodes** (IF, Switch, Merge) → Decision points in workflow.md\n   - **Connections** → Step ordering and data flow in workflow.md\n4. Extract the underlying workflow logic as a structured design\n5. Preserve the original n8n JSON as `reference/original_n8n.json` in the output system\n6. Continue to Step 3 with the translated design\n\n**Failure mode**: If the n8n JSON is malformed or contains unsupported node types, log the specific issues and generate a partial conversion with TODO markers for unsupported elements.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Research\n\nIdentify available tools and resources for the system.\n\n1. Read `config/mcp_registry.md` — what MCPs are available?\n2. Read `library/tool_catalog.md` — what reusable tool patterns exist?\n3. Read `library/patterns.md` — does this problem match a known pattern?\n4. For each capability the system needs:\n   - Check if an MCP provides it (preferred — less code to maintain)\n   - Check if a tool pattern exists in the catalog (reusable — faster to implement)\n   - Plan a custom tool if nothing exists (document as a new pattern candidate)\n5. Document the research findings: which MCPs, patterns, and tools will be used\n\n**Failure mode**: If the MCP registry is empty or missing, fall back to direct HTTP/API tools. The system must work without any specific MCP.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Design\n\nArchitect the workflow for the new system.\n\n1. Break the problem into discrete steps — each step should do one thing clearly\n2. Define the order: which steps depend on which?\n3. Identify decision points: where does the workflow branch based on conditions?\n4. Define failure modes for each step: what can go wrong and what's the fallback?\n5. Define inputs and outputs for each step\n6. **Design Subagents** — identify specialist subagents for the system:\n   - **Every system gets subagents**. Subagents are the DEFAULT delegation mechanism. For each major phase or capability in the workflow, define a specialist subagent.\n   - For each subagent, define:\n     - **name**: lowercase-with-hyphens identifier (e.g., `search-specialist`, `data-processor`)\n     - **description**: When Claude should delegate to this subagent (used for automatic delegation)\n     - **tools**: Which Claude Code tools this subagent needs (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, etc.) — grant only what's needed\n     - **model**: `sonnet` for most tasks, `haiku` for simple/fast tasks, `opus` for complex reasoning\n     - **permissionMode**: `default` unless the subagent needs autonomous writes (`acceptEdits`)\n     - **system_prompt**: Detailed instructions — the subagent's domain expertise, how to use its tools, expected inputs/outputs, error handling\n   - **Delegation hierarchy** (critical):\n     - **Subagents are the default** for all task delegation within a system. When the workflow reaches a phase, delegate to its specialist subagent.\n     - **Agent Teams is ONLY used** when the design identifies 3+ truly independent tasks that can run in parallel. Agent Teams is a parallelization optimization, not a delegation mechanism.\n     - A system can use BOTH: subagents for delegation AND Agent Teams for parallel execution of independent subagent tasks.\n   - Document all subagents in the design output — they will be generated in Step 5b\n7. **Agent Teams Analysis** — evaluate whether this system ALSO benefits from Agent Teams:\n   - **Count independent tasks**: List all tasks that have no data dependencies on each other\n   - **Apply the 3+ Independent Tasks Rule**:\n     - **3 or more independent tasks** → Recommend Agent Teams. Flag these tasks for parallel execution with the native team lead/teammate pattern. Set `enable_agent_teams` to true.\n     - **Fewer than 3 independent tasks** → Sequential execution is sufficient. Note in the design that Agent Teams is not recommended.\n   - **Assess parallelization benefit**: Will concurrent execution meaningfully reduce total time? (e.g., 3 API calls at 10s each → 10s parallel vs 30s sequential = meaningful)\n   - **Check merge complexity**: Can the parallel results be combined without complex reconciliation? If merging is harder than the parallel speedup, prefer sequential.\n   - **Document the decision**: Record in the design whether Agent Teams is recommended, which tasks would run in parallel, and the rationale\n   - **If Agent Teams is recommended**: Define team roles:\n     - **Team Lead responsibilities**: What the coordinator does (create task list, spawn teammates, merge results, quality control)\n     - **Teammate definitions**: For each parallel task, define the scoped instructions, expected inputs, and expected outputs\n     - **Shared task list structure**: What tasks appear on the list, their dependencies (blockedBy/blocks), and completion criteria\n   - **If Agent Teams is NOT recommended**: Design for sequential execution only. Note why (e.g., \"all tasks depend on previous output\" or \"only 2 independent tasks — overhead not justified\")\n   - **Regardless of recommendation**: The design MUST include a sequential execution path. Agent Teams is always an optimization, never a requirement.\n8. Select the workflow pattern from `library/patterns.md` that best fits (or define a new one)\n\n**Failure mode**: If the problem is too vague to design a clear workflow, generate a minimal viable workflow with TODO markers and document what clarification is needed.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3b: Factory Parallel Build (Agent Teams)\n\n**This step applies to the factory's own build process, not the generated system.**\n\nWhen the factory is building a complex system (4+ tools or multiple independent workflow phases), it can use Agent Teams to generate artifacts in parallel. This accelerates the build without affecting the output.\n\n1. **Check if Agent Teams is enabled**: Read `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` from the environment\n2. **Assess build complexity**:\n   - Count the number of tools to generate\n   - Count the number of independent generation steps (workflow, tools, Actions, CLAUDE.md)\n   - **If 4+ generation artifacts AND Agent Teams enabled**: Use parallel build\n   - **Otherwise**: Continue to Steps 4–7 sequentially (skip this step)\n3. **If parallel build**: The factory team lead creates a shared task list and spawns teammates:\n   - **Task: Generate Workflow** — Teammate generates `workflow.md` from the design (Step 4)\n   - **Task: Generate Tools** — Teammate generates all Python tools from the design (Step 5)\n   - **Task: Generate GitHub Actions** — Teammate generates `.github/workflows/` files (Step 6)\n   - **Task: Generate CLAUDE.md** — Teammate generates the system's CLAUDE.md (Step 7)\n   - Each teammate receives the full design from Step 3 as context\n   - Each teammate writes its output to the system's output directory\n4. **Team lead collects and validates**: After all teammates complete, the team lead:\n   - Verifies all expected files were generated\n   - Checks cross-references (e.g., workflow.md mentions tools that exist in `tools/`)\n   - Resolves any conflicts or inconsistencies\n   - Proceeds to Step 8 (Test)\n\n**Sequential fallback**: If Agent Teams is not enabled, Steps 4–7 execute sequentially as defined below. Results are identical.\n\n**Failure mode**: If a teammate fails, the team lead falls back to generating that artifact sequentially. A partial parallel build is still faster than fully sequential.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Generate Workflow\n\nWrite the system's `workflow.md`.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/generate_workflow.py` with the design from Step 3\n2. Follow the structure in `factory/templates/workflow_template.md`\n3. Include:\n   - Clear header with system name and purpose\n   - Inputs section with expected parameters\n   - Outputs section with deliverables\n   - Numbered steps with sub-steps\n   - Decision points with bold conditional text\n   - Failure modes and fallback steps for every step\n4. **If Agent Teams applies**: Include parallel execution sections using `factory/templates/agent_teams_template.md`\n   - Define which steps run as sub-agents\n   - Define the merge/coordination logic\n   - Include a sequential fallback section\n\n**Failure mode**: If workflow generation fails, write a minimal skeleton workflow.md with the key steps and TODO markers.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Generate Tools\n\nWrite Python tools for each action step.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/generate_tools.py` with the workflow steps from Step 4\n2. For each action step in the workflow:\n   - Check `library/tool_catalog.md` for a reusable pattern\n   - If found: adapt the pattern for this system's specific needs\n   - If not found: generate a new tool following `factory/templates/tool_template.py`\n3. Every tool MUST have:\n   - Module docstring (purpose, inputs, outputs)\n   - `main()` entry point\n   - `try/except` error handling\n   - `logging` integration\n   - Type hints\n4. **If Agent Teams is used**: Generate sub-agent task definitions using `factory/tools/generate_agent_teams.py`\n5. Generate `requirements.txt` listing all Python dependencies\n\n**Failure mode**: If a tool cannot be generated (e.g., requires an unknown API), create a stub tool with clear TODO markers and document what's missing.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5b: Generate Subagents\n\nCreate `.claude/agents/` markdown files for the system's specialist subagents.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/generate_subagents.py` with the subagent definitions from Step 3\n2. For each subagent defined in the design:\n   - Generate a markdown file following `factory/templates/subagent_template.md`\n   - YAML frontmatter with: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `permissionMode`\n   - Detailed system prompt in the markdown body covering:\n     - What the subagent specializes in\n     - Which tools to use and how\n     - Expected inputs and outputs\n     - Step-by-step execution instructions\n     - Failure handling procedures\n3. Place all subagent files in `{system_dir}/.claude/agents/`\n4. Validate each subagent file:\n   - Frontmatter parses as valid YAML\n   - `name` is lowercase-with-hyphens only\n   - `tools` lists only valid Claude Code tools\n   - `model` is one of: sonnet, opus, haiku, inherit\n   - System prompt is non-empty and specific to the domain\n\n**Failure mode**: If a subagent file fails validation, fix the issue and regenerate. If generation fails entirely, create stub subagent files with TODO markers — the system should still work without subagents (Claude will use tools directly).\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Generate GitHub Actions\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/` files for the new system.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/generate_github_actions.py` with the system design\n2. Using `factory/templates/github_action_template.yml`, create the main workflow:\n   - Configure triggers based on the system's needs (dispatch, cron, webhook)\n   - Set up Python environment and dependencies\n   - Inject required secrets (reference GitHub Secrets, NEVER hardcode)\n   - Run Claude Code with the system's workflow.md\n   - Commit results back to the repo\n   - Configure failure notifications\n   - Set `timeout-minutes` on every job\n3. Using `factory/templates/agent_hq_template.yml`, create `agent_hq.yml`:\n   - Respond to issue assignment and @claude mentions\n   - Parse issue body as task input\n   - Submit results as draft PR\n   - Support iterative feedback\n\n**Failure mode**: If trigger configuration is ambiguous, default to `workflow_dispatch` with a manual input parameter.\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Generate CLAUDE.md\n\nWrite the system's operating instructions.\n\n1. Using `factory/templates/claude_md_template.md`, generate CLAUDE.md with:\n   - System identity and purpose\n   - Required MCPs and their alternatives\n   - Expected inputs and outputs\n   - How to execute the workflow\n   - **Subagents section**: List all subagents, when to delegate to each, and how to chain them\n   - **Delegation hierarchy**: Subagents are the default, Agent Teams only for parallel execution\n   - Agent Teams configuration (if any) with token cost notes\n   - Agent HQ usage instructions\n   - Secret requirements (names only, never values)\n   - Troubleshooting common issues\n2. This file MUST serve double duty:\n   - Instructions for Claude Code when running via CLI or GitHub Actions\n   - Context for GitHub Agent HQ when running via issue assignment\n\n**Failure mode**: If unsure about MCP requirements, list all possible MCPs with notes on which are required vs. optional.\n\n---\n\n## Step 8: Test (3-Level Validation Gates)\n\nValidate the generated system through three progressive levels. **Each level must pass before proceeding to the next.** Do not skip levels. Do not proceed past a failing gate.\n\n### Level 1: Syntax & Structure\n\nVerify every generated file is syntactically valid and structurally correct.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/test_tools.py` in syntax-only mode against each generated tool\n2. For each Python tool file:\n   - **AST parse**: Verify the file is valid Python (`python -c \"import ast; ast.parse(open('{tool}').read())\"`)\n   - **Import check**: Verify the file imports without errors (`python -c \"import importlib; importlib.import_module('{tool_module}')\"`)\n   - **Structure check**: Verify `main()` exists and is callable\n   - **Docstring check**: Verify module-level docstring exists\n   - **Error handling check**: Verify at least one `try/except` block exists (AST inspection)\n3. For each workflow/markdown file:\n   - Verify it is non-empty\n   - Verify it has required sections (Inputs, Outputs for workflow.md)\n4. For each YAML file (.github/workflows/):\n   - Verify valid YAML syntax\n   - Verify `timeout-minutes` is set on every job\n5. For each subagent file (.claude/agents/):\n   - Verify YAML frontmatter parses correctly\n   - Verify required fields (`name`, `description`) are present\n   - Verify `name` is lowercase-with-hyphens only\n   - Verify system prompt body is non-empty\n6. Log all Level 1 results\n\n**Gate**: ALL files must pass Level 1. If any file fails:\n- Attempt automatic fix (syntax errors, missing docstrings, missing main())\n- Re-run Level 1 on the fixed files\n- If auto-fix fails after 2 attempts, log the failure and halt the build\n\n**Failure mode**: If the testing infrastructure itself fails, generate a manual Level 1 checklist in README.md and proceed to Level 2 with a warning.\n\n### Level 2: Unit Tests\n\nVerify each tool produces correct output for sample inputs.\n\n1. For each Python tool:\n   - Run with sample/mock inputs: `python tools/{tool_name}.py --help` (verify argparse works)\n   - Run with minimal valid input and verify:\n     - Exit code is 0 on success\n     - Output is valid JSON (if tool outputs JSON)\n     - Output contains expected keys/structure\n   - Run with invalid input and verify:\n     - Exit code is non-zero\n     - Error message is meaningful (not a raw traceback)\n     - The tool does not hang or crash silently\n2. For tools that call external APIs:\n   - Verify the tool handles missing API keys gracefully (clear error message, non-zero exit)\n   - If the PRP provides mock data, use it for testing\n   - If no mock data, verify the tool's error path (missing credentials) works correctly\n3. Verify `requirements.txt` contains all dependencies used by the tools\n4. Log all Level 2 results\n\n**Gate**: ALL tools must pass Level 2. If any tool fails:\n- Read the error output, identify the root cause\n- Fix the tool code (not the test)\n- Re-run Level 2 on the fixed tool\n- If fix fails after 2 attempts, log the failure and halt the build\n\n**Failure mode**: If external APIs are unreachable and no mock data exists, verify error handling paths only and document untested happy paths in README.md.\n\n### Level 3: Integration Tests\n\nVerify tools work together as a pipeline and the system is complete.\n\n1. **Pipeline test**: Simulate the workflow end-to-end with sample data\n   - Run tools in workflow order, passing each tool's output as the next tool's input\n   - Verify the final output matches expected format and contains expected data\n   - Verify no tool drops data or produces incompatible output for the next step\n2. **Cross-reference validation**:\n   - Verify workflow.md references only tools that exist in `tools/`\n   - Verify CLAUDE.md documents every tool, subagent, and secret\n   - Verify .github/workflows/ YAML references correct tool paths and secret names\n   - Verify .env.example lists every secret referenced in CLAUDE.md and GitHub Actions\n   - Verify README.md covers all three execution paths\n3. **Subagent integration**:\n   - Verify each subagent file in `.claude/agents/` is referenced in CLAUDE.md\n   - Verify subagent tool lists contain only valid Claude Code tools\n   - Verify subagent descriptions match the workflow phases they serve\n4. **Package completeness**:\n   - Verify all required system files exist (CLAUDE.md, workflow.md, tools/, .github/workflows/, requirements.txt, README.md, .env.example, .gitignore)\n   - Verify no hardcoded secrets in any file (scan for common patterns: `sk-`, `api_key=`, bearer tokens)\n5. Log all Level 3 results\n\n**Gate**: ALL integration checks must pass. If any fail:\n- Identify the inconsistency (e.g., workflow.md references a tool that does not exist)\n- Fix the source file\n- Re-run Level 3\n- If fix fails after 2 attempts, log the failure and halt the build\n\n**Failure mode**: If the full pipeline cannot be tested (e.g., requires live API access), test each tool independently with sample data and document the untested integration path in README.md.\n\n---\n\n## Step 9: Package\n\nBundle everything into a deployable system.\n\n1. Run `factory/tools/package_system.py`\n2. Create the output directory: `systems/{system_name}/`\n3. Place all files:\n   - `CLAUDE.md` (from Step 7)\n   - `workflow.md` (from Step 4)\n   - `tools/` (from Step 5)\n   - `.claude/agents/` (from Step 5b)\n   - `.github/workflows/` (from Step 6)\n   - `requirements.txt` (from Step 5)\n4. Generate `README.md` with:\n   - System overview\n   - Setup instructions for ALL THREE execution paths:\n     - **(a) Claude Code CLI**: Clone repo, set env vars, run `claude` with workflow.md\n     - **(b) GitHub Actions dispatch**: Push to GitHub, configure secrets, trigger via Actions UI or API\n     - **(c) GitHub Agent HQ**: Assign issue to @claude with task description in issue body\n   - Required secrets list\n   - Example usage for each path\n5. Verify the package is complete: all required files present, no hardcoded secrets\n\n**Failure mode**: If any files are missing, log what's missing and package what exists with a TODO list in README.md.\n\n---\n\n## Step 10: Learn\n\nExtract learnings and update the factory's knowledge base.\n\n1. Review the system that was just built — what patterns were used?\n2. **Update `library/patterns.md`**:\n   - If a new pattern was discovered, add it with a description and example\n   - If an existing pattern was refined, update its entry\n3. **Update `library/tool_catalog.md`**:\n   - If new tool patterns were created, catalog them for reuse\n   - If existing tool patterns were improved, update their entries\n4. **If this was an n8n conversion**:\n   - Save the n8n-to-WAT mapping in `converters/n8n_examples/` for future reference\n5. Log what worked well and what was difficult — this informs future improvements\n6. Commit all library updates\n\n**Failure mode**: If learning extraction fails, the system build is still valid — learning is a bonus, not a requirement.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770813644609}}

Pull target fields using CSS selectors, XPath, or Claude-driven semantic extraction.\n4. **Transform** -- Normalize data types, deduplicate, validate schema. Python scripts or inline Claude processing.\n5. **Output** -- Write results to a file in the repo (`data/`, `output/`), post to an API, or commit as a structured artifact.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP** -- lightweight HTTP retrieval, returns Markdown-converted content.\n- **Puppeteer / Playwright MCP** -- for JavaScript-rendered pages requiring a headless browser.\n- **Python** -- pandas, BeautifulSoup, or custom scripts for heavy transformation.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- write results to disk.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 6 * * *'   # daily at 06:00 UTC\n  workflow_dispatch:        # manual trigger\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Scrape competitor pricing pages nightly; output a CSV diff showing changes.\n- Collect job postings from three sites; normalize into a single JSON feed committed to the repo.\n- Pull public government data tables and convert to machine-readable Parquet files.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Retry with backoff** on transient HTTP errors (429, 503).\n- **Schema validation** after extraction -- if required fields are missing, flag the record rather than silently dropping it.\n- **Stale-data guard** -- if fetch returns identical content to last run, skip processing and log \"no change.\"\n- **Alert on structural change** -- if selectors return zero matches (site redesign), open a GitHub Issue for human review.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Research > Analyze > Report\n\n**Summary:** A multi-source research workflow that gathers information from diverse sources (web, APIs, local files), synthesizes findings with Claude, and produces a formatted report committed to the repository.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need to compile information from multiple sources into a single coherent document.\n- Periodic market research, competitive analysis, or literature reviews.\n- Any task where a human would spend hours reading and summarizing.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Define research brief** -- Specify the topic, questions to answer, source priorities, and output format.\n2. **Gather sources** -- Query web search, fetch specific URLs, read local reference files, call APIs.\n3. **Extract key findings** -- For each source, pull relevant facts, quotes, data points. Tag each with provenance.\n4. **Analyze and synthesize** -- Claude cross-references findings, identifies patterns, contradictions, and gaps.\n5. **Generate report** -- Produce a structured Markdown document with sections, citations, and an executive summary.\n6. **Commit and notify** -- Commit the report to the repo. Optionally open a PR or send a notification.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Web Search MCP / Fetch MCP** -- gather online sources.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read local reference documents.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit output, open issues or PRs.\n- **Claude (extended thinking)** -- deep analysis and synthesis.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'   # weekly on Monday at 09:00 UTC\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      topic:\n        description: 'Research topic'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Weekly competitive landscape report that tracks new features announced by three competitors.\n- Monthly technology radar summarizing emerging tools relevant to the team's stack.\n- Ad-hoc deep-dive report triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch` with a topic input.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Source fallback** -- if a primary source is unreachable, log it and proceed with remaining sources. Note gaps in the report.\n- **Confidence scoring** -- Claude flags low-confidence claims; the report includes a \"Caveats\" section.\n- **Minimum-source threshold** -- if fewer than N sources are successfully retrieved, abort and open an issue rather than publishing a thin report.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Monitor > Detect > Alert\n\n**Summary:** A continuous monitoring system that periodically checks a target (website, API, dataset, repo) for changes, applies detection logic, and fires alerts or triggers downstream workflows when significant changes are found.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want to be notified when something changes: a webpage, an API response, a competitor's pricing, a regulatory filing.\n- You need a lightweight, Git-native alternative to commercial monitoring SaaS.\n- Ideal for cron-triggered GitHub Actions that run on a schedule.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Fetch current state** -- Retrieve the current snapshot of the monitored target.\n2. **Load previous state** -- Read the last-known state from a file committed in the repo (e.g., `state/last_snapshot.json`).\n3. **Diff** -- Compare current vs. previous. Use structural diff for JSON, text diff for prose, hash comparison for binary.\n4. **Evaluate significance** -- Apply rules or Claude-based judgment to determine if the change is meaningful (filter noise).\n5. **Alert** -- If significant: open a GitHub Issue, send a Slack message, trigger a downstream workflow via `repository_dispatch`, or all three.\n6. **Persist new state** -- Commit the current snapshot as the new baseline.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP / Puppeteer MCP** -- retrieve current state from web targets.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write state files.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- open issues, trigger dispatches.\n- **Slack MCP** -- send alert messages.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '*/30 * * * *'  # every 30 minutes\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Monitor a government regulatory page for new filings; alert the legal team via Slack when a new document appears.\n- Watch a competitor's changelog page; open a GitHub Issue summarizing each detected update.\n- Track an API's response schema for breaking changes; alert the engineering team.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Transient failure tolerance** -- if the fetch fails, do NOT overwrite previous state. Log the failure. After N consecutive failures, escalate to an alert.\n- **False-positive suppression** -- use Claude to evaluate whether a detected \"change\" is meaningful (e.g., ignore timestamp-only diffs).\n- **State corruption recovery** -- if state file is missing or unparseable, re-initialize from scratch and log a warning instead of crashing.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Intake > Enrich > Deliver\n\n**Summary:** A data enrichment pipeline that receives raw input (from a form, webhook, file drop, or API), augments it with additional data from external sources, and delivers the enriched result to its destination.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- Incoming data is incomplete and needs augmentation before it is useful.\n- You are building a lead enrichment, content tagging, or metadata enhancement system.\n- Raw data arrives in one format and must be transformed and enriched before storage or delivery.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Intake** -- Receive raw data. Sources: webhook payload, new file in repo, manual trigger with JSON input, or a watched directory.\n2. **Validate** -- Check that required fields exist and data types are correct. Reject malformed input early.\n3. **Enrich** -- For each record, call enrichment sources: web search for context, APIs for supplementary data, Claude for classification or summarization.\n4. **Merge** -- Combine original data with enrichment results into a unified schema.\n5. **Deliver** -- Write enriched data to its destination: commit to repo, POST to API, append to a dataset file, or open a PR.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Web Search MCP** -- find supplementary information.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- call enrichment APIs.\n- **Claude** -- classify, tag, summarize, or score records.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read input, write output.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit results or open PRs.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'inbox/**'          # new file dropped in inbox\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      payload:\n        description: 'JSON data to enrich'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- A sales team drops a CSV of company names into `inbox/`; the pipeline enriches each with industry, size, website, and LinkedIn URL, then writes to `data/enriched_leads.csv`.\n- Incoming support tickets are enriched with customer history and sentiment score before routing.\n- Raw RSS feed items are enriched with summaries, topic tags, and relevance scores.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Per-record error isolation** -- if enrichment fails for one record, mark it as `enrichment_failed` and continue processing the rest. Do not let one bad record kill the batch.\n- **Rate-limit awareness** -- track API call counts; pause and retry when rate-limited rather than failing fast.\n- **Partial delivery** -- deliver successfully enriched records on schedule; queue failed records for retry in the next run.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Generate > Review > Publish\n\n**Summary:** A content generation pipeline with built-in quality gates. Claude generates draft content, a review step validates quality and compliance, and approved content is published to its destination.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- Automated content creation (blog posts, documentation, social media, release notes) where quality must be verified before publishing.\n- Any workflow where you want a \"human-in-the-loop\" approval step or an automated quality check before output goes live.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Brief** -- Define the content requirements: topic, audience, tone, length, format, and any reference material.\n2. **Generate** -- Claude produces a first draft using the brief and any provided reference material.\n3. **Automated review** -- Run quality checks: spelling/grammar, factual consistency against source material, tone analysis, compliance rules (e.g., no prohibited claims).\n4. **Gate decision** -- If automated review passes, proceed. If it fails, loop back to step 2 with feedback (max N retries). Optionally, require human approval via a PR review.\n5. **Publish** -- Commit final content to the repo, deploy to a CMS via API, or post to a platform.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Claude** -- generation and review (use separate system prompts for generator vs. reviewer to create genuine separation).\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read briefs, write drafts and final output.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- open a draft PR for human review; merge on approval.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- publish to external CMS or platform APIs.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [labeled]        # label \"content-request\" triggers generation\n  pull_request_review:\n    types: [submitted]      # human approval triggers publish\n  workflow_dispatch:\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Weekly changelog: gather merged PRs, generate a formatted changelog, open a PR for team review, publish on approval.\n- Blog post pipeline: issue labeled \"draft-request\" triggers generation; editor reviews the PR; merge triggers deployment.\n- Social media batch: generate a week's worth of posts, run brand-voice review, output approved posts to a scheduling queue.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Retry budget** -- if automated review rejects the draft, regenerate with targeted feedback up to 3 times. After that, escalate to a human by opening an issue.\n- **Rollback on publish failure** -- if the publish step fails (API error), keep the approved content in the repo and log the failure for manual retry.\n- **Diff guard** -- before publishing, diff against previously published content to prevent accidental overwrite of manual edits.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Listen > Decide > Act\n\n**Summary:** An event-driven agent that listens for incoming events (webhooks, GitHub events, messages), applies decision logic to determine the appropriate response, and takes autonomous action.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need a system that reacts to external events in near-real-time.\n- Webhook-triggered GitHub Actions are the execution engine.\n- The appropriate response depends on the content of the event (routing, triage, conditional logic).\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Receive event** -- GitHub Actions triggers on the event (webhook, issue creation, PR comment, `repository_dispatch`).\n2. **Parse and classify** -- Extract relevant data from the event payload. Use Claude to classify intent or severity if the input is unstructured (e.g., natural language).\n3. **Decide** -- Apply decision logic: rule-based routing, Claude-driven triage, or a lookup table. Determine which action(s) to take.\n4. **Act** -- Execute the chosen action: respond to the issue, trigger another workflow, call an API, update a file, or escalate to a human.\n5. **Log** -- Record the event, decision, and action taken for auditability.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **GitHub MCP** -- read event payloads, respond to issues/PRs, trigger dispatches.\n- **Claude** -- classify, triage, and decide.\n- **Slack MCP** -- notify humans when escalation is needed.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- call external APIs as part of the action.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened, labeled]\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [incoming_webhook]\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Triage bot: new issues are classified by Claude (bug, feature, question) and auto-labeled, assigned, and replied to with relevant templates.\n- Deployment gatekeeper: a PR comment like \"/deploy staging\" triggers a deployment workflow after validating the commenter's permissions.\n- Customer feedback router: webhook delivers feedback; Claude scores sentiment and routes critical items to Slack.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Idempotency** -- design actions to be safe to retry. Use event IDs to detect and skip duplicate deliveries.\n- **Decision logging** -- log the full decision chain (event > classification > decision > action) so failures can be diagnosed.\n- **Safe defaults** -- if classification confidence is low, default to escalation (notify a human) rather than taking an autonomous action that might be wrong.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Collect > Transform > Store\n\n**Summary:** A classic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline where Git serves as the data store. Data is collected from external sources, transformed into a canonical format, and committed to the repository as versioned, queryable files.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want a version-controlled data lake without standing up a database.\n- Small-to-medium datasets (tens of MB) that benefit from Git's diff, history, and branching.\n- Data pipelines where auditability and reproducibility matter more than query speed.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Collect** -- Pull data from source(s): APIs, web scrapes, file uploads, other repos.\n2. **Validate** -- Check data integrity: schema validation, null checks, type enforcement.\n3. **Transform** -- Normalize, clean, reshape. Convert to the canonical schema. Deduplicate against existing data in the store.\n4. **Diff** -- Compare transformed data against the current version in the repo. Compute what is new, changed, or deleted.\n5. **Store** -- Commit the updated dataset files to the repo. Use meaningful commit messages describing what changed (e.g., \"Add 14 new records from source X\").\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP** -- pull data from APIs and web sources.\n- **Python** -- pandas or custom scripts for transformation.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write data files.\n- **GitHub MCP / Git CLI** -- commit, push, branch as needed.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # every 6 hours\n  workflow_dispatch:\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Collect cryptocurrency prices from three APIs every 6 hours; store as daily CSV files in `data/prices/`.\n- Pull open government datasets weekly; transform into a normalized schema; maintain a living dataset in the repo.\n- Aggregate internal metrics from multiple microservice health endpoints; store as JSON for a dashboard.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Atomic commits** -- only commit if the entire pipeline succeeds. Never commit partial or corrupted data.\n- **Schema drift detection** -- if source data no longer matches the expected schema, abort and alert rather than storing malformed data.\n- **Rollback via Git** -- if bad data is committed, revert the commit. The previous state is always recoverable.\n- **Dedup safety** -- idempotent writes ensure that re-running the pipeline does not create duplicate records.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Fan-Out > Process > Merge\n\n**Summary:** The Agent Teams pattern. A coordinator agent splits a large task into independent sub-tasks, dispatches them to parallel sub-agents (or sequential iterations), collects all results, and merges them into a unified output.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- A task is naturally decomposable into independent units of work (e.g., process each file, research each topic, analyze each competitor).\n- You want to reduce wall-clock time by parallelizing work.\n- The final deliverable requires combining results from multiple sub-tasks.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Plan** -- The coordinator analyzes the task and determines how to decompose it. Produces a work manifest: a list of sub-tasks with their inputs.\n2. **Fan-Out** -- Dispatch each sub-task. Options: parallel GitHub Actions jobs via a matrix strategy, sequential Claude tool calls, or `repository_dispatch` events to separate workflows.\n3. **Process** -- Each sub-agent executes its sub-task independently. Results are written to a known location (e.g., `temp/results/task_01.json`).\n4. **Collect** -- The coordinator waits for all sub-tasks to complete and gathers their outputs.\n5. **Merge** -- Combine results: concatenate, deduplicate, reconcile conflicts, and produce the final unified output.\n6. **Deliver** -- Commit the merged output or pass it to the next stage in a larger pipeline.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Claude** -- coordinator logic, sub-task execution, merge logic.\n- **GitHub Actions matrix** -- parallel job execution.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write intermediate and final results.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- coordinate via issues, artifacts, or dispatch events.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      task_manifest:\n        description: 'JSON array of sub-tasks'\n        required: true\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [fan_out_request]\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Analyze 20 competitor websites: fan out one sub-agent per competitor, each produces a profile, merge into a single competitive analysis report.\n- Process a batch of 50 documents: each sub-agent summarizes one document, merge into a master summary with cross-references.\n- Multi-language translation: fan out one sub-agent per target language, merge all translations into a localized content bundle.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Partial success tolerance** -- if some sub-tasks fail, merge the successful results and report failures. Do not discard all work because of one failure.\n- **Retry failed sub-tasks** -- the coordinator can re-dispatch failed sub-tasks up to N times before giving up.\n- **Timeout enforcement** -- set a maximum wall-clock time for the fan-out phase. Collect whatever is done when the timer expires.\n- **Conflict resolution** -- if sub-task results conflict, the merge step uses Claude to reconcile or flags the conflict for human review.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Issue > Execute > PR\n\n**Summary:** The GitHub Agent HQ pattern. An agent receives a task specification via a GitHub Issue, autonomously executes the required workflow, and delivers the results as a draft Pull Request for human review.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want a human-in-the-loop task queue where work is requested via Issues and delivered via PRs.\n- The agent should be fully autonomous in execution but the output requires human approval before merging.\n- Building an internal tool where non-technical stakeholders can request work by opening an Issue.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Receive** -- A new Issue is opened (or an existing Issue is labeled with a trigger label like `agent-task`). GitHub Actions fires.\n2. **Parse task** -- Claude reads the Issue body and extracts the task specification: what to do, inputs, constraints, expected output.\n3. **Create branch** -- Create a feature branch named after the Issue (e.g., `agent/issue-42`).\n4. **Execute** -- Run the appropriate workflow or pattern to complete the task. This might invoke any other pattern in this catalog.\n5. **Commit results** -- Commit all output files to the feature branch with clear commit messages.\n6. **Open draft PR** -- Open a draft PR linked to the original Issue. The PR body includes a summary of what was done, key decisions made, and anything that needs human attention.\n7. **Comment on Issue** -- Post a comment on the Issue linking to the PR and summarizing the outcome.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **GitHub MCP** -- read issues, create branches, commit, open PRs, post comments.\n- **Claude** -- parse task, execute logic, generate summaries.\n- **Any other MCP** -- depending on the task being executed.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened, labeled]\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]       # support \"/execute\" command in comments\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- A product manager opens an Issue: \"Research top 5 CRM tools and compare features.\" The agent researches, builds a comparison table, and opens a PR with the report.\n- An engineer opens an Issue: \"Add unit tests for the auth module.\" The agent generates tests and delivers them as a PR.\n- A stakeholder opens an Issue: \"Update the pricing page data for Q1.\" The agent pulls new data, updates the files, and opens a PR for review.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Status updates** -- the agent comments on the Issue at each major step (\"Starting research...\", \"Generating report...\", \"Opening PR...\") so progress is visible.\n- **Graceful failure** -- if the agent cannot complete the task, it comments on the Issue with a clear explanation of what went wrong and what it tried, then labels the Issue `agent-failed` for human triage.\n- **Scope guard** -- if Claude determines the task is ambiguous or out of scope, it asks a clarifying question in the Issue comments rather than guessing.\n- **Draft-only PRs** -- all PRs are opened as drafts. The agent never merges its own work.\n\n---\n\n## 10. n8n Import > Translate > Deploy\n\n**Summary:** A conversion pattern that ingests an n8n workflow JSON export, translates it into a WAT-native system (Claude Code + MCP + GitHub Actions), and deploys it as a fully functional GitHub-native workflow.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You are migrating from n8n (or a similar visual workflow tool) to a GitHub-native architecture.\n- You want to leverage existing workflow logic without manually rewriting it.\n- You are evaluating whether an n8n workflow can run as a WAT system to reduce infrastructure dependencies.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Import** -- Read the n8n workflow JSON file. This contains nodes, connections, credentials references, and configuration.\n2. **Parse and map** -- Walk the node graph. For each n8n node type, identify the equivalent WAT component:\n   - HTTP Request node -> Fetch MCP call\n   - Code (JavaScript/Python) node -> inline script or Python file\n   - IF/Switch node -> Claude decision logic or conditional in workflow\n   - Webhook trigger -> `repository_dispatch` or `workflow_dispatch`\n   - Cron trigger -> `schedule` trigger in GitHub Actions\n   - Set/Merge nodes -> data transformation in Claude or Python\n3. **Translate** -- Generate the WAT system files:\n   - `.github/workflows/*.yml` -- GitHub Actions workflow definition.\n   - `prompts/` -- Claude system prompts for nodes that require AI logic.\n   - `scripts/` -- Python or shell scripts for code nodes.\n   - `config/` -- Configuration extracted from the n8n workflow.\n4. **Validate** -- Dry-run the generated workflow. Check that all node types were mapped, no credentials are hardcoded, and the control flow is correct.\n5. **Deploy** -- Commit the generated files to the repo. Open a PR with a detailed summary of the translation, noting any nodes that required manual review or could not be auto-translated.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read n8n JSON, write generated files.\n- **Claude** -- interpret node logic, generate prompts, translate code, produce workflow YAML.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit files, open PR.\n- **Python** -- parse n8n JSON, generate boilerplate.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'imports/n8n/*.json'   # drop an n8n export to trigger conversion\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      n8n_file:\n        description: 'Path to n8n JSON file in the repo'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Migrate a 15-node n8n lead-scoring workflow to a Git-versioned, GitHub Actions-powered system.\n- Convert an n8n social media posting pipeline into a WAT **Generate > Review > Publish** system.\n- Translate an n8n monitoring workflow into a WAT **Monitor > Detect > Alert** pattern, eliminating the need for a running n8n instance.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Unsupported node catalog** -- maintain a list of n8n node types that cannot be auto-translated. When encountered, flag them in the PR description with a `TODO` and a suggested manual implementation.\n- **Credential safety** -- never translate credentials. Replace all credential references with GitHub Secrets placeholders (`${{ secrets.SERVICE_API_KEY }}`) and document which secrets need to be configured.\n- **Fidelity check** -- generate a side-by-side comparison of the n8n flow and the translated WAT flow so a human reviewer can verify correctness.\n- **Incremental migration** -- support translating a subset of the n8n workflow, allowing teams to migrate node-by-node rather than all-at-once.\n\n---\n\n## Pattern Composition Quick Reference\n\nPatterns are building blocks. Here are common compositions:\n\n| Composition | How It Works |\n|---|---|\n| **Monitor > Detect > Alert** + **Issue > Execute > PR** | Monitor detects a change, opens an Issue, which triggers the agent to act and deliver a PR. |\n| **Issue > Execute > PR** using **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** | A complex Issue task is decomposed and parallelized internally before the PR is opened. |\n| **Scrape > Process > Output** feeding **Collect > Transform > Store** | Scraping output is piped into the ETL pattern for versioned storage. |\n| **Listen > Decide > Act** routing to any pattern | An event-driven dispatcher that selects and triggers the appropriate pattern based on the event. |\n| **n8n Import > Translate > Deploy** producing any pattern | The translator identifies which WAT pattern best fits the n8n workflow and generates accordingly. |\n\n---\n\n## Choosing a Pattern\n\n| Question | Recommended Pattern |\n|---|---|\n| Do I need to pull data from websites? | **Scrape > Process > Output** |\n| Do I need to synthesize information from many sources? | **Research > Analyze > Report** |\n| Do I need to watch for changes over time? | **Monitor > Detect > Alert** |\n| Do I need to augment incoming data? | **Intake > Enrich > Deliver** |\n| Do I need AI-generated content with quality control? | **Generate > Review > Publish** |\n| Do I need to react to external events? | **Listen > Decide > Act** |\n| Do I need versioned data storage without a database? | **Collect > Transform > Store** |\n| Do I need to parallelize a large task? | **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** |\n| Do I need a task queue with human approval? | **Issue > Execute > PR** |\n| Do I need to migrate an n8n workflow? | **n8n Import > Translate > Deploy** |\n| Do I need B2B lead generation from web data? | **Intake > Enrich > Deliver** (lead-gen variant) |\n\n---\n\n## Proven Compositions (from builds)\n\n### Lead Generation Pipeline (lead-gen-machine)\n- **Pattern**: Intake > Enrich > Deliver + Scrape > Process > Output\n- **Flow**: Parse profile > Search web > Scrape sites > Extract contacts (Claude) > Score leads > Output CSV\n- **Key insight**: The Intake > Enrich > Deliver pattern works well when the \"enrichment\" involves multi-step web scraping + AI extraction. Each company is an independent unit of work, making this a strong candidate for Fan-Out > Process > Merge parallelization.\n- **Scoring pattern**: Decompose match criteria into independent dimensions (industry, size, location, keywords) with weighted point values. This makes the scoring transparent and tunable.\n- **Fallback chains**: Firecrawl > HTTP+BeautifulSoup for scraping, Claude > regex for extraction. Always have a degraded-but-functional fallback.\n\n### Marketing Pipeline (marketing-pipeline)\n- **Pattern**: Intake > Enrich > Deliver + Generate > Review > Publish\n- **Flow**: Ingest CSV > Enrich via Apollo/Hunter/Brave/Claude > Deep-score (5 dimensions) > Segment (Hot/Warm/Cold) > Generate outreach (Hot) > Generate nurture (Warm) > Output CSVs + emails\n- **Key insight**: Multi-API enrichment with graceful degradation. Apollo (primary) > Hunter (email verification) > Brave (research) > Claude (pain analysis). Each API layer adds value but the system works with only Anthropic API.\n- **Scoring pattern**: 5-dimension scoring (size fit, tech stack compatibility, budget signals, accessibility, pain signals) with transparent point breakdown. More dimensions = more nuanced than lead-gen-machine's 4-dimension approach.\n- **Content generation pattern**: Outreach and nurture are independent post-segmentation, making them natural Agent Teams candidates. Outreach is per-lead personalized; nurture is aggregate-informed.\n- **API fallback chain**: Apollo > Hunter > Brave > Claude > HTTP scraping. Four-level fallback with clear degradation at each level.\n- **CSV-in/CSV-out**: Accepts CSV input (compatible with lead-gen-machine output), produces segmented CSVs + markdown email sequences. Easy to chain systems.\n\n### Website Uptime Monitor (website-uptime-monitor)\n- **Pattern**: Monitor > Log (simplified from Monitor > Detect > Alert)\n- **Flow**: Check URL via HTTP GET > Measure response time > Determine up/down status > Append to CSV > Commit to Git\n- **Key insight**: Simplest possible monitoring system - no detection logic, no alerting, just raw data collection. Every check produces a log entry regardless of status. Git history IS the audit trail.\n- **No MCPs needed**: Direct Python `requests` library is simpler and more reliable than Fetch MCP for a single GET request. CSV append uses stdlib. Zero external dependencies beyond GitHub Actions.\n- **Exit code signaling**: Tool exits 0 if up, 1 if down - GitHub Actions UI shows workflow as \"failed\" when site is down, providing at-a-glance status without additional alerting logic.\n- **Concurrency handling**: GitHub Actions `concurrency` setting prevents simultaneous runs. Git push includes retry with rebase to handle rare concurrent commits.\n- **CSV as database**: Append-only CSV committed to Git provides versioned, auditable, queryable dataset. No external database needed. Git handles MB-scale data easily.\n- **Cron variance accepted**: GitHub Actions cron has ±5 minute variance - documented as expected behavior rather than a bug to fix.\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) Scheduled cron (primary), (2) Manual dispatch (testing), (3) Local CLI (development). Agent HQ (4) optional for issue-driven tasks.\n- **Cost awareness**: ~1,440 GitHub Actions minutes/month for 5-minute checks. Fits within free tier (2,000/month private, unlimited public).\n- **Extensibility points**: Add alerting by extending monitor.yml (Slack webhook, GitHub Issue). Add multiple URLs via matrix strategy or separate workflows. Add authentication via tool arguments + GitHub Secrets.\n\n### CSV-to-JSON Converter (csv-to-json-converter)\n- **Pattern**: Collect > Transform > Store\n- **Flow**: Collect CSV files > Analyze structure > Parse CSV > Infer types > Validate data > Convert to JSON/JSONL > Generate reports > Commit\n- **Key insight**: Multi-phase transformation with specialist subagents. Each phase (analyze, infer, validate, write) has a dedicated subagent with focused responsibilities. Main agent orchestrates the pipeline.\n- **Subagent architecture**: Four specialist subagents (csv-analyzer, type-inference-specialist, data-validator, json-writer) with minimal tool access. Subagents are the DEFAULT delegation mechanism, not Agent Teams.\n- **Type inference pattern**: Statistical analysis with confidence scoring (80% threshold). Detects int, float, boolean, datetime, string. Falls back to string for ambiguous columns. Handles 10+ null value representations.\n- **Encoding detection**: chardet for automatic encoding detection with UTF-8 fallback. Strips BOM (byte order mark) automatically. Supports UTF-8, Latin-1, Windows-1252, etc.\n- **Ragged row handling**: Pad short rows with null, truncate long rows with warning. Log all issues in validation report but continue processing (graceful degradation).\n- **Validation without failure**: Validator NEVER raises exceptions. Always returns a report. Strict mode controls whether issues halt the pipeline, but validation itself is fail-safe.\n- **JSONL streaming**: For large files (1M+ rows), JSONL format writes one record at a time. No array wrapper. Memory-efficient for multi-GB datasets.\n- **Batch processing modes**: Sequential (1-2 files) or parallel (3+ files with Agent Teams). Parallel is 5x faster wall time but same token cost. Always has sequential fallback.\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) CLI for local development, (2) GitHub Actions for production, (3) Agent HQ for issue-driven tasks. All three produce identical output.\n- **Metadata reporting**: run_summary.json (machine-readable) + validation_report.md (human-readable). Includes per-file stats, type inference results, validation issues, recommendations.\n- **No secrets required**: Uses only stdlib (csv, json, pathlib) + chardet + python-dateutil. No external APIs. Pure data transformation pipeline.\n- **Git commit discipline**: Stage ONLY output files (never `git add -A`). Commit message includes file count, row count, timestamp. Output directory is parameterized.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770813644610}}

The system must maintain state between runs to track which posts have been seen, handle feed errors gracefully, and work without human intervention.\n\n## Why\n- **Automation**: Eliminates manual RSS reader checking across multiple sources\n- **Consolidation**: One daily email instead of fragmented feed reader notifications\n- **Time savings**: Users get curated updates at a predictable time without constant monitoring\n- **Reliability**: GitHub Actions ensures consistent daily execution without a server\n- **User impact**: Content consumers, researchers, and teams monitoring multiple sources daily\n\n## What\nA stateful RSS monitoring pipeline that fetches feeds, deduplicates against previous runs, formats new content into an HTML email digest grouped by source, and delivers via SMTP. Results are tracked in a Git-committed state file, providing auditability and recovery.\n\n### Success Criteria\n- [ ] System fetches multiple RSS/Atom feeds without failing the entire run if one feed is down\n- [ ] New posts are correctly identified by comparing against state file (last run timestamp + seen GUIDs)\n- [ ] Email digest is sent via SMTP with HTML formatting, grouped by feed source\n- [ ] Each digest entry includes: feed name, post title (linked), summary/description, publish date\n- [ ] State file is updated and committed after successful email send\n- [ ] System runs autonomously via GitHub Actions on schedule (daily at 8 AM UTC)\n- [ ] If no new posts, no email is sent (silent run with state update)\n- [ ] All three execution paths work: CLI, GitHub Actions, Agent HQ\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\n[What goes into the system.

Pattern selection is solid.\n- [Tool Design]: High confidence — feedparser is battle-tested, SMTP is stdlib, state management is straightforward JSON. All tools have clear inputs/outputs and proven patterns.\n- [Error Handling]: High confidence — per-feed error isolation, retry logic for SMTP, state rollback on failure. Failure modes are well-defined.\n- [MCP/Library Requirements]: High confidence — feedparser handles RSS/Atom normalization, smtplib is stdlib, no exotic dependencies. Fallbacks are clear.\n- [Validation Strategy]: High confidence — 3-level validation is well-defined with concrete test commands. Integration test covers full pipeline.\n- [Scale Consideration]: Medium confidence — Sequential feed fetching works for typical 5-20 feeds (10-60s runtime). For 50+ feeds, parallel fetch may be needed, but sequential is correct starting point.\n- [Email Formatting]: High confidence — MIME multipart with HTML + plain-text is standard pattern. Grouping by feed is straightforward.\n- [State Management]: High confidence — Composite guid key prevents duplicates, max_guids prevents unbounded growth, commit-after-send prevents data loss.\n\n**Ambiguity flags** (areas requiring clarification before building):\n- [ ] None — all requirements are clear and executable. The system can be built as-is.\n\n**Ready to build**: YES — confidence score 9/10, no ambiguity flags, all patterns proven, all failure modes handled.\n\n---\n\n## Factory Build Prompt\n\nWhen this PRP is ready, execute the build with:\n\n```\n/execute-prp PRPs/rss-digest-monitor.md\n```\n\nThis will trigger `factory/workflow.md` with the above requirements as structured input.\n"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","usage":{"input":14,"output":12517,"cacheRead":8632,"cacheWrite":37090,"totalTokens":58253,"cost":{"input":0.000042000000000000004,"output":0.187755,"cacheRead":0.0025896,"cacheWrite":0.1390875,"total":0.3294741}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1770813644614}}

Support multiple feeds, group posts by feed source, and include title, link, summary, and publish date in the digest. Use GitHub Actions for scheduling and SMTP for email delivery. Run daily at 8 AM UTC. Track new posts since last run using a local state file. HTML email format with nice formatting.\n\n## Research Phase\n\n### Pattern Selection\n- **Primary Pattern**: Monitor > Collect > Transform > Deliver (with state persistence)\n- **Rationale**: Clear sequential workflow: check feeds → filter new posts → format digest → send email → update state\n- **Modifications**: Added state loading before Collect, state saving after Deliver, per-feed error handling\n\n### MCP Analysis\n- **Fetch MCP**: Available for HTTP requests, fallback to `requests` library\n- **Filesystem MCP**: Available for state I/O, fallback to `pathlib` stdlib\n- **Email**: No MCP needed - `smtplib` stdlib is sufficient\n\n### Tool Catalog Review\n- **rest_client pattern**: Adapted for RSS feed fetching with retry logic\n- **json_read_write pattern**: Used for state persistence\n- **email_send pattern**: Adapted for SMTP with TLS\n\n### Library Selection\n- **feedparser**: Industry standard for RSS/Atom parsing, handles malformed XML and encoding issues\n- **python-dateutil**: Robust date parsing for varied feed date formats\n- **smtplib + email.mime**: Stdlib modules for email composition and SMTP delivery\n\n## Design Phase\n\n### Subagent Architecture\n3 specialist subagents defined:\n1. **rss-fetcher-specialist** (sonnet, Read/Bash): Fetch and parse feeds, handle HTTP errors\n2. **digest-generator-specialist** (sonnet, Read/Write): Format HTML email with grouping\n3. **state-manager-specialist** (haiku, Read/Write/Bash): State persistence and guid tracking\n\n### Agent Teams Analysis\n**Decision**: Sequential execution (NO Agent Teams)\n**Rationale**: \n- While feed fetching is parallelizable, typical 5-10 feeds complete in 10-30 seconds sequentially\n- State comparison requires all fetches to complete (sequential dependency)\n- Agent Teams overhead not justified for small feed counts\n- For 50+ feeds, parallel fetch could be future optimization\n\n### Workflow Steps\n6 sequential steps with clear failure modes and fallbacks:\n1. Load State (or initialize on first run)\n2. Fetch RSS Feeds (per-feed error handling)\n3. Filter New Posts (composite guid key deduplication)\n4. Generate HTML Digest (skip if no new posts)\n5. Send Email via SMTP (retry once on failure)\n6. Update State (commit only after successful email)\n\n### Tools Designed\n6 Python tools following catalog patterns:\n- `load_state.py` - JSON read with initialization fallback\n- `fetch_rss_feeds.py` - feedparser with per-feed try/except\n- `filter_new_posts.py` - Composite key (feed_url + guid) deduplication\n- `generate_html_digest.py` - MIME multipart HTML + plain-text\n- `send_email_smtp.py` - smtplib with TLS and retry\n- `save_state.py` - JSON write with max_guids enforcement\n\n## Validation Strategy\n\n### Level 1: Syntax & Structure\n- AST parse all 6 tools\n- Import check for dependencies\n- Verify main() function exists\n- Validate subagent YAML frontmatter\n\n### Level 2: Unit Tests\n- Test load_state with missing file (first run)\n- Test fetch_rss_feeds with real Hacker News RSS\n- Test filter_new_posts with sample data\n- Test generate_html_digest with sample posts\n- Test save_state with sample guids\n\n### Level 3: Integration Tests\n- Full pipeline simulation with temp directory\n- Verify tool chain: load → fetch → filter → generate\n- Cross-reference validation (workflow.md ↔ tools/)\n- YAML validity check\n\n## Known Gotchas Addressed\n1. **Feed errors**: Per-feed try/except prevents single failure killing run\n2. **GUID uniqueness**: Composite key (feed_url + guid) prevents cross-feed collisions\n3. **Date parsing**: python-dateutil handles varied formats, fallback to current time\n4. **State growth**: Max 10,000 seen_guids enforced to prevent unbounded growth\n5. **Email compatibility**: MIME multipart with plain-text fallback\n6. **Commit timing**: State committed AFTER email send to prevent data loss on failure\n7. **SMTP auth**: Documented Gmail App Password requirement\n\n## Confidence Breakdown\n\n**High Confidence Areas (9/10 overall)**:\n- Workflow pattern selection: Proven Monitor > Transform > Deliver pattern\n- Tool design: feedparser is battle-tested, stdlib for email/state\n- Error handling: Per-feed isolation, SMTP retry, state rollback\n- Validation: 3-level gates with concrete test commands\n\n**Medium Confidence Areas**:\n- Scale: Sequential fetch works for typical 5-20 feeds (10-60s), may need parallelization for 50+ feeds\n\n**No Ambiguity Flags**: All requirements are clear and executable\n\n## Ready to Build\n✓ Confidence score: 9/10  \n✓ No ambiguity flags  \n✓ All patterns proven  \n✓ All failure modes handled  \n✓ Validation strategy complete  \n\n**Status**: READY FOR FACTORY EXECUTION\n\n## Next Steps\nExecute factory build with:\n```\n/execute-prp PRPs/rss-digest-monitor.md\n```\n"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","usage":{"input":13,"output":1601,"cacheRead":45722,"cacheWrite":12543,"totalTokens":59879,"cost":{"input":0.000039,"output":0.024015,"cacheRead":0.013716599999999999,"cacheWrite":0.04703625,"total":0.08480685}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1770813860113}}

Commit updated state to repository\n\n### Key Features\n\n✓ **GitHub Actions scheduling**: Runs daily at 8 AM UTC  \n✓ **Multi-feed support**: Configured via `config/feeds.json`  \n✓ **Per-feed error handling**: One feed failure doesn't kill the entire run  \n✓ **State persistence**: Tracks seen posts to prevent duplicates  \n✓ **Composite guid key**: Prevents cross-feed collisions  \n✓ **HTML + plain-text email**: MIME multipart for compatibility  \n✓ **Graceful degradation**: Handles missing dates, malformed XML, SMTP failures  \n✓ **Bounded state growth**: Max 10,000 seen guids enforced  \n\n### Why 9/10 Confidence?\n\n**High confidence** in:\n- Workflow pattern (proven Monitor > Transform > Deliver)\n- Tool design (feedparser is battle-tested, stdlib for email/state)\n- Error handling (per-feed isolation, SMTP retry, state rollback)\n- Validation strategy (3-level gates with concrete test commands)\n\n**Medium confidence** in:\n- Scale: Sequential feed fetching works for 5-20 feeds (10-60s), may need parallelization for 50+ feeds in the future\n\n**No ambiguity flags**: All requirements are clear. The system can be built as-is.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo build the system, execute:\n```bash\n/execute-prp PRPs/rss-digest-monitor.md\n```\n\nThis will trigger the WAT Systems Factory to generate the complete working system in `systems/rss-digest-monitor/` with all tools, workflows, GitHub Actions, documentation, and validation tests.\n\n---\n\n**Commit**: `0e0d306` - PRP committed with confidence score in message for automated pipeline decisions"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929","usage":{"input":13,"output":862,"cacheRead":60980,"cacheWrite":143,"totalTokens":61998,"cost":{"input":0.000039,"output":0.01293,"cacheRead":0.018293999999999998,"cacheWrite":0.00053625,"total":0.03179925}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770813916096}}
