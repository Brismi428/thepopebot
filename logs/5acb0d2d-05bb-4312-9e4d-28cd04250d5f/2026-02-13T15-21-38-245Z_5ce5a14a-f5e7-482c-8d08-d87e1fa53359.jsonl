When teaching does not match how their brain works, school can begin to feel frustrating, and confidence often takes a hit.\n\nStars School & Learning Center is a private nonprofit day school in Weymouth, Massachusetts, serving students in **grades 1-8** with dyslexia and other language-based learning differences.\n\nWe offer a structured, supportive environment with small class sizes, evidence-based instruction, and individualized support; all rooted in scientific research and best practices.\n\n### What your child can expect:\n\n* A **personalized learning plan** based on diagnostic information\n* Expert instruction from **Orton-Gillingham** certified teachers, using state-of-the-art materials and proven methods to address specific learning differences\n* **Individual academic support** to build skills and confidence\n* A school community that values **belonging, friendships, and a love of learning**\n\nUnder the leadership of Dr. Renée Heywood, Stars School & Learning Center continues a strong legacy of supporting children with language-based learning differences. Our belief is simple: when students receive the right instruction, they can thrive both academically and emotionally.\n\nIn addition to our day school, students may also participate in enrichment, summer, and after-school programs.\n\n### Is Stars School & Learning Center the right fit?\n\n**This school may be a good fit if your child:**\n\nIs bright but struggles with reading, writing, or language\n\nHas dyslexia or a language-based learning difference\n\nHas ADHD as a co-occurring challenge\n\nNeeds structured, multi-sensory instruction\n\nIs not thriving in a traditional classroom\n\n**This may not be the right fit if:**\n\nYour child does not have language-based learning needs\n\nYou are looking for a general enrichment program\n\nYour child is best served in a large, traditional classroom\n\n### Upcoming Events\n\n### In-Person\n\nMarch 5 @ 5:30 pm - 7:00 pm\n\n### Virtual\n\nMarch 9 @ 11:30 am - 12:00 pm\n\nMarch 9 @ 6:00 pm - 6:30 pm\n\n![STARS-2-richard](https://southshorestars.org/wp-content/uploads/bb-plugin/cache/STARS-2-richard-300x300-circle-674efcd78e5057c82d9c6dec0e82057c-niqy4pfsgad5.webp \"STARS-2-richard\")\n\n#### Meet our School Director\n\n### Richard Bransfield\n\nRichard Bransfield is a highly respected educator with more than 40 years of service in K–12 public education. He began his career as an elementary and middle school teacher and also coached three varsity high school teams. Rich later moved into school leadership, serving first as an assistant principal for grades 5–8 and then as principal of a K–8 school. \nIn Weymouth Public Schools, he led both the Talbot School and the Wessagusset School before completing his career as the district’s Executive Director of Elementary Education.\n\nRich is widely recognized for his expertise in literacy. Throughout his career, he worked to strengthen principals’ and district leaders’ understanding of the Science of Reading and championed the use of research-based, developmentally appropriate instruction.

Families interested in the Stars School & Learning Center are encouraged to start by submitting an inquiry to learn more about our program and determine whether it may be the right fit for their child.\n\nAfter an initial inquiry, our admissions team will schedule a call with your family to discuss your child’s learning profile, answer questions, and share next steps. If appropriate, families are then invited to complete an application and are provided with any required forms as part of that process.\n\n### School Information Packet\n\nFamilies are encouraged to review our School Information Packet, which provides a deeper overview of our program, educational approach, and admissions process. This resource is designed to help families learn more about the Stars School & Learning Center prior to or during the inquiry stage.\n\n### Ready to Get Started?\n\nChoosing the right school can feel overwhelming. Our admissions team is here to guide you, answer questions, and help you determine whether Stars School & Learning Center is the right fit for your child.\n\n## News, Press, & Updates\n\n* ## [DESE Approval for Grades K–8 at Stars School & Learning Center](https://southshorestars.org/dese-approval-for-grades-k-8-at-stars-school-learning-center/ \"DESE Approv\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: SOUTH SHORE STARS INC - GuideStar Profile\nLink: https://www.guidestar.org/profile/23-7097840\nSnippet: | www.southshorestars.org · Since 1970, South Shore Stars has committed to <strong>nurturing children&#x27;s growth in the South Shore region of Boston, MA</strong>.

It’s dedicated to elementary students with language-based learning needs, such as dyslexia. Stars is an offshoot of the South Shore Stars educational nonprofit, which started as a daycare in the early ‘70s and evolved to include youth programming for all ages.\n\nGet Starting Point\n\nA guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday.\n\nEnter Email\n\nFormer Weymouth Schools Superintendent, principal, and classroom teacher Jennifer Curtis leads the school with a staff certified in Orton-Gillingham, including a speech and language pathologist and multiple reading specialists. Orton-Gillingham is a phonics-intensive, research-based method often used with dyslexic students. Aside from specialized instruction, Curtis says Stars resembles a mainstream elementary school, with specials like music and gym.\n\nStars tuition is $67,000. Curtis says that Stars has received provisional approval as a state-approved 766 school. These schools offer specialized private instruction and can work with school districts to access a portion of tuition through the circuit-breaker program, a state-funded reimbursement process. This means that, in some cases, qualifying students could receive out-of-district placements from their home district with a portion of costs covered.\n\n“\\[The tuition\\] makes me cringe a little every time I say it. It’s a lot of money. But, if you look at all the 766 schools out there, we’re surprisingly a lot less,” Curtis says. (Day student tuition at Landmark, a well-regarded 766 North Shore school focusing on dyslexia for kids in 2nd through 12th grades, is $75,500.)\n\nI talked to Curtis about the new school’s approach and about what students with dyslexia — which affects about 20 percent of the population — really need to succeed.\n\n![Sign up for Parenting Unfiltered.](https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/Z2IMEE234NDYJG35TCB376FG4M.jpg?auth=e8b5a1fc8a656a2a4bf16c98c0fb26b0ae9c259c5a85a7bfb652ea26c7cc3e66&width=1440)\n\nSign up for Parenting Unfiltered.Globe staff\n\n**What’s a 766 school? Does that mean Stars is a therapeutic school?**\n\nIt doesn’t have to do with anything as far as being more therapeutic — or more, or less, of something. It’s about complying with regulations that the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education put forward to meet certain benchmarks. They audit; we work collaboratively with them.\n\nThis then allows us to have school districts access funds, called circuit-breaker funding, to send students \\[from their\\] district into our program. Does it cover all of the tuition for the school district? No, but it does give some relief if a school district has to send someone to a different placement. From a parent lens, this is called out-of-district placement.\n\n**Does the funding go to parents or to schools?**\n\nIt depends. If a family is going through the IEP process and their team decides that the district does not have the services within its own programming, and the team decides it’s a better placement for a child, they work with the 766 school to develop a contract, and they send children directly. Sometimes, unfortunately, families have to hire advocates or attorneys, and it becomes a bit more litigious.\n\nWe need a minimum of 12 kids to be enrolled to open our doors. We’ve had a lot of interest from families, and we’re also working with school districts that may have students to place; we’re looking at assessment packages and different student profiles to see if they’re a good fit for the program itself.\n\n**What type of documentation or testing is recommended? I know that neuropsych testing independently can be prohibitively expensive.**\n\nSome families might have a full battery of assessments, but some families do not. Some families are coming to us with the data from the dyslexia screeners from their school departments, or they’re coming with curriculum-based assessments that their school department is doing. We’re looking at that information and then taking anecdotal data to see if we’re a good fit for their child. Is a neuropsychological test good practice? Yes. But do you have to have that? No. Our team is skilled, so a lot of them can do advanced testing if needed.\n\n**Who’s the student population?**\n\nThe program has been developed for kids with dyslexia or language-based learning needs.\n\nWe’re making sure that our instruction is focused on being systematic, multi-sensory, and sequential, with certified Orton-Gillingham instructors. Our staff will have the training to personalize instruction based upon the learner’s needs. The ratio will be extremely low; at times, one staff member to three students.\n\nWe’re scheduled to have a full-time speech and language pathologist on staff, and we really feel as though that makes a difference: It’s not just a pull-out of 30 minutes five times a week.

Developed and led by South Shore Stars CEO Jennifer Curtis-Whipple, Ed.D., a former Superintendent of Weymouth Public Schools, the school is a natural extension of Stars’ five-decade commitment to early education, academic enrichment, and family support.\n\nLocated at 163 Libbey Parkway in Weymouth, Stars School & Learning Center will be the first school of its kind on Boston’s South Shore, offering an innovative, evidence-based, multisensory curriculum grounded in the Science of Reading within a highly supportive learning environment. Enrollment is open year-round, and Stars is able to accommodate mid-year transfer students. As a nonprofit, Chapter 766-approved day school, Stars accepts both private-pay students and those placed by public school districts. Recently approved tuition rates by the Massachusetts Operational Services Division will allow public districts to access state and municipal funding for appropriate student placements.\n\nThe idea for the school was ignited three years ago when State Senator Patrick O’Connor introduced Dr. Curtis-Whipple to a group of parents seeking a solution for the lack of resources on the South Shore. In February 2023, Stars committed to launching a new school to fill that void. With necessary approvals now in place, the board recently voted to allocate all necessary resources to guarantee opening for the 2025-2026 school year.\n\n“This program is a major need on the South Shore, and similar programs throughout the eastern part of the state are full. Dyslexic students are all too frequently faced with instruction that is poorly executed and leaves the child unable to read at a useful level,” says Nancy Duggan, founder of Decoding Dyslexia of MA and a Stars board member. “The entire board recognizes the pain that parents of dyslexic students experience when their children are unhappy and, often, depressed by the gap they can see between their abilities and their classmates.”\n\nStars has begun hiring Orton-Gillingham trained and certified teachers, Speech and Language Pathologists, and additional elementary school staff and expects to be fully staffed by July 31st. The school recently completed a $1.4 million remodeling project to create classrooms and learning spaces tailored to the needs of students with dyslexia, language-based learning needs, ADHD, and additional features to support teaching and learning for this population of children. The upgraded space features a state-of-the-art gross motor and sensory space that allows children to engage with self-regulation tools and explore a multitude of resources and equipment. A scholarship fund is being established, and leadership is now refocusing its fundraising efforts toward ensuring future financial flexibility and a sustainable future for the school and the organization.\n\n“The community needs this program, and we have worked hard to get to a point where we are able to begin providing these services. All children deserve high-quality education, and we are ready to offer this specialized instruction for children with dyslexia,” said Dr. Curtis-Whipple. “We are grateful to Quincy Mutual, South Shore Bank, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Senator Patrick O’Connor, and countless others who have helped us realize this important step forward for education on the South Shore.”\n\n--- Result 7 ---\nTitle: How can Massachusetts help public school students with dyslexia? | GBH\nLink: https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2024-01-17/how-can-massachusetts-help-public-school-students-with-dyslexia\nAge: January 17, 2024\nSnippet: Curtis said South Shore Stars is ... 766 approval, which would <strong>allow public school districts to use funds that are allocated towards special education needs to send children to South Shore Stars</strong>....\nContent:\nMassachusetts is failing to provide sufficient instruction to students with dyslexia. That’s according to recent [reporting](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/11/metro/dyslexia-resources-ma-schools/) by the Boston Globe, which estimates there could be up to 180,000 dyslexic students enrolled in state public schools.\n\nWhile there are federal [standards](https://sites.ed.gov/idea/) for screening children for dyslexia required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the issue lies in connecting children with the tailored instruction they need to learn how to read. Currently, Massachusetts does not mandate specific teaching methods for dyslexia.\n\n“You need trained professionals to implement this type of teaching, and that's very expensive,” Jennifer Curtis, the former superintendent of Weymouth Public Schools, told _Boston Public Radio_ on Wednesday. Beyond cost, Curtis said there aren't enough teachers trained in effective methodologies for teaching dyslexic students to read.\n\nDyslexia is a language-based learning disability caused by a neurological difference in how someone interprets written language into sound. “To say this squiggle on the page makes this sound in the English language, that's a learned behavior,” said Nancy Duggan, executive director of Decoding Dyslexia Massachusetts. “It's learned like swimming or basketball or playing the cello.”\n\nPeople with dyslexia have a harder time making those connections. The key is early intervention.\n\n“The younger we work with the students, the more likely we are able to help remedy and give them the toolbox and the skills they need to be successful readers as adults,” said Curtis.\n\nCurtis and Duggan would like to see the Orton-Gillingham method used consistently in the Commonwealth’s public schools. It’s a systematic teaching method that uses phonics and explicit meaning and is approved by the International Dyslexia Association.\n\nSome private schools are offering reading education tailored for dyslexic students to fill the gaps in the public school system. Curtis is the CEO of South Shore Stars school in Weymouth, which is focused on teaching students of a variety of learning differences.\n\nYet the cost of these schools, which can be tens of thousands of dollars a year, could be prohibitive to the state’s neediest students. Curtis said South Shore Stars is working with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to receive Chapter 766 approval, which would allow public school districts to use funds that are allocated towards special education needs to send children to South Shore Stars.\n\nAfter receiving instruction tailored to their learning differences, the student would then return to their school districts. “They need to go out and be in their own neighborhoods,” Curtis said.\n\nAt the state level, Duggan said it’s time to reframe standardized reading curriculum. The lack of curriculum standards should be seen “not as a problem of local control and state control, but of consumer protection,” she said. “We should spend \\[money\\] on products that are proven reliable.”\n\n--- Result 8 ---\nTitle: Stars School & Learning Center in Weymouth Sets Opening Date for September 2025\nLink: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stars-school-learning-center-weymouth-142000744.html\nAge: May 21, 2025\nSnippet: As a nonprofit, Chapter 766-approved day school, Stars <strong>accepts both private-pay students and those placed by public school districts</strong>.

Developed and led by South Shore Stars CEO Jennifer Curtis-Whipple, Ed.D., a former Superintendent of Weymouth Public Schools, the school is a natural extension of Stars’ five-decade commitment to early education, academic enrichment, and family support.\n\nLocated at 163 Libbey Parkway in Weymouth, Stars School & Learning Center will be the first school of its kind on Boston’s South Shore, offering an innovative, evidence-based, multisensory curriculum grounded in the Science of Reading within a highly supportive learning environment. Enrollment is open year-round, and Stars is able to accommodate mid-year transfer students. As a nonprofit, Chapter 766-approved day school, Stars accepts both private-pay students and those placed by public school districts. Recently approved tuition rates by the Massachusetts Operational Services Division will allow public districts to access state and municipal funding for appropriate student placements.\n\nThe idea for the school was ignited three years ago when State Senator Patrick O’Connor introduced Dr. Curtis-Whipple to a group of parents seeking a solution for the lack of resources on the South Shore. In February 2023, Stars committed to launching a new school to fill that void. With necessary approvals now in place, the board recently voted to allocate all necessary resources to guarantee opening for the 2025-2026 school year.\n\n“This program is a major need on the South Shore, and similar programs throughout the eastern part of the state are full. Dyslexic students are all too frequently faced with instruction that is poorly executed and leaves the child unable to read at a useful level,” says Nancy Duggan, founder of Decoding Dyslexia of MA and a Stars board member. “The entire board recognizes the pain that parents of dyslexic students experience when their children are unhappy and, often, depressed by the gap they can see between their abilities and their classmates.”\n\nStars has begun hiring Orton-Gillingham trained and certified teachers, Speech and Language Pathologists, and additional elementary school staff and expects to be fully staffed by July 31st. The school recently completed a $1.4 million remodeling project to create classrooms and learning spaces tailored to the needs of students with dyslexia, language-based learning needs, ADHD, and additional features to support teaching and learning for this population of children. The upgraded space features a state-of-the-art gross motor and sensory space that allows children to engage with self-regulation tools and explore a multitude of resources and equipment. A scholarship fund is being established, and leadership is now refocusing its fundraising efforts toward ensuring future financial flexibility and a sustainable future for the school and the organization.\n\n“The community needs this program, and we have worked hard to get to a point where we are able to begin providing these services. All children deserve high-quality education, and we are ready to offer this specialized instruction for children with dyslexia,” said Dr. Curtis-Whipple. “We are grateful to Quincy Mutual, South Shore Bank, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Senator Patrick O’Connor, and countless others who have helped us realize this important step forward for education on the South Shore.”\n\n--- Result 3 ---\nTitle: South Shore Stars to open this fall: Date, tuition cost, how to enroll\nLink: https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/education/2025/06/23/special-needs-school-dyslexia-adhd-weymouth-ma-jennifer-curtis-karen-whipple/84225101007/?gnt-cfr=1&gca-cat=p&gca-uir=false&gca-epti=z113302p001850c001850v113302&gca-ft=190&gca-ds=sophi&gnt-djm=1\nAge: June 24, 2025\nSnippet: South Shore Stars, a nonprofit education program, will open a new school for students who have a variety of learning differences this fall.\nContent:\nJune 23, 2025Updated June 24, 2025, 3:29 p.m. ET\n\n[South Shore Stars](https://southshorestars.org/), a nonprofit education program, will open [a new school for students](https://www.patriotledger.com/story/news/2023/05/22/weymouth-ma-south-shore-stars-dyslexia-new-school/70223228007/) who have a variety of learning differences this fall.\n\nThe Stars School & Learning Center will serve as a private, nonprofit day school for children in first through fifth grades with dyslexia and other language-based learning differences.

It ties into my value system, who I am, my professional career, and what I want to do.\"\n\nThe nonprofit organization provides early education and youth development programs around the region.\n\nCurtis-Whipple said she has enjoyed working with \"so many students and families\" during her 25-year education career in Weymouth.\n\n“I specifically enjoyed working with students that have difficulty learning and being able to support them, see them flourish and grow with the right teaching strategies,” she said.\n\nCurtis-Whipple, a 1991 Weymouth High School graduate, began her education career as a kindergarten teacher at Nash Primary School in 1995.\n\n“I had multiple teacher jobs in the area of general education and literacy,” she said. “I then moved into the administration as a principal at Academy Avenue School.”\n\nCurtis-Whipple worked as a teacher for 15 years before she was promoted to principal in 2010 by then-Superintendent Mary Jo Livingstone, 54, a 1975 Weymouth South High School graduate who died unexpectedly of natural causes in April 2011.\n\n “We have a lot of staff members that grew up here, and still live here, and chose to work here,” she said. \"I think it is nice for the community and great for the kids to see.”\n\nCurtis Whipple was appointed assistant superintendent in August 2014 by former Superintendent Kenneth Salim.\n\nHer duties included coordinating curriculum instruction, special education, English as a second language or ESL, and early childhood education.\n\nThe School Committee appointed Curtis-Whipple to serve as superintendent in April 2016, after Salim accepted a superintendent position with the Cambridge Public Schools.\n\nShe said the school district is unique because of the dedicated work done by all employees.\n\n“I think our teachers, staff, food service workers, custodians, and administrators go above and beyond for the kids,” Curtis-Whipple said. “I think we work hard to provide as many opportunities as possible so kids and families can flourish.”\n\nShe said the dedication of school employees is evident at the Johnson Early Childhood.\n\n“When you go to the Johnson preschool, it is amazing to see the range of students that are so successful in the education setting,” Curtis-Whipple said. “That is because of the hard work done by our staff.”\n\nShe said the high school’s Career and Technology Education program provides a wide range of vocational programs for students.\n\nThe CTE program offers instruction in health, automotive technology, construction, cosmetology, culinary arts, drafting and design, early childhood education, graphic communication, information technology, and metal fabrication.\n\n“We have a phenomenal CTE program as well as an evening high school, which is amazing,” Curtis-Whipple said.\n\nEvening High School Principal Michelle Prendergast said Curtis-Whipple was very supportive of the academic program, including students of all ages.\n\n\"She told me the evening school graduation ceremony was one of her favorite calendar events of the year,\" she said. \"She has always said, if there was anything I needed, I could reach out to her. I always felt she had confidence in me to do the job, and that is always nice to have. I wish her well in her future endeavors.\"\n\nCurtis-Whipple said the schools have also been enhanced by students taking part in athletics, drama, and music programs.\n\n\"When I was in high school, the drama program was under the direction of Jan Smith,\" she said. \"She was amazing, and she got me to come out of my shell a little bit.\"\n\nSmith served as director of the Weymouth High Theater Company for 30 years until she retired in June 2011.\n\nSome of Smith’s well-known students included Actor Nate Corddry, a 1995 Weymouth High graduate, and his classmate Donnie Norton, director of the high school theater company.\n\n\"It is telling when you see how far people further themselves professionally,\" Curtis-Whipple said. “One thing I do love is how so many people come back to support students grow into their potential and give back to the school system.”\n\n![The demol\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: Stars School & Learning Center in Weymouth Sets Opening Date for September 2025\nLink: https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/education/stars-school-and-learning-center-in-weymouth-sets-opening-date-for-september-2025-1030340\nSnippet: <strong>Developed and led by South Shore Stars CEO Jennifer Curtis-Whipple, Ed.D., a former Superintendent of Weymouth Public Schools</strong>, the school is a natural extension of Stars&#x27; five-decade commitment to early education, academic enrichment, and family ...\nContent:\n(HTTP 403)\n\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770996197105}}

No. Our team is skilled, so a lot of them can do advanced testing if needed.\"\n> \n> Source: Boston Globe, January 31, 2025\n\nThis flexible approach means families should not delay applying if they don't have comprehensive testing.\n\n### For District-Placed Students\n\nIf seeking placement through a public school district:\n\n1.
