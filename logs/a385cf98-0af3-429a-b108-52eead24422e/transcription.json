And in this video, I will show you exactly how to use it and build a fully functional SAS in less than nine minutes. We will create a beautiful landing page user authentication dashboard, team management, security, and even stripe payment integration. So by the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to build your own SAS in the most efficient, fast way possible. Let's get started. So I've been experimenting with what the best way to kind of start a new SAS would be. It's always changing. There's all these new frameworks. You can use Cloud Code to help you build it from scratch. They're super based. And I started to just look around. I was like, is there a framework that has a lot of people actually using it? So there's 15,000 people. And it's actually built by next JS. So that's a good sign. Like you want to pick something that's going to be around. You don't want to pick something and then all of a sudden nobody's using it anymore. So you do need to have Git and your terminal already set up. So I'm going to open up a new terminal and I'm going to run this command. You can copy all of it. I'm just going to do it one at a time. Just so you can see. So we're going to clone the repository. So what does that mean? We're cloning the code here on this page. I'll run that. And if you see that we have all this code here. So we just downloaded all that. So everything we see here, I come to the terminal here. We've got it here in the folder. And then it asks us to CD into that folder and then to run PNPM install. So I don't have it. I'm just going to ask Cloud Code or Cloud. Can I also Google it? I just clotted. So Cloud's running slow. Let's go to... I already have node installed. CorePack enabled. All right. Quick pause here for some context. Stephen asked ChatGPT what's the best way to install PNPM on Mac? The result said he needs to have node.js installed on his system, which he has already done. Then he needs to enable CorePack using the bash command. This is what he's about to do now. Let's see if we got it. Man, life is so much easier. CorePack. OK, cool. Looks like it's working. So we're going to do the command that failed. I'm going to do another quick pause here. Stephen had to enable CorePack first, then run the original PNPM install command. Now that he's done that, we can see the program download here in terminal. So now what we're going to do is we're going to log in with Stripe. Now, what the I'm going to do with Stripe is I'm going to just create a new test account. So I'm going to create a separate account for testing, SAS, starter. Let's do the basic install. I could have probably skipped this, go to the sandbox. And now one thing to keep in mind, same way I said at this PNPM, I already had this Stripe program installed on my computer. So you're going to want to go install the Stripe CLI. When you are running your SAS locally, you've got this front end. What's running in your browser? It's running on your computer inside of your home network. So you've got the internet out here. And your home network is protecting you from anyone on the internet from accessing your site. So when you set this up and Stripe is trying to send information to your website, it can't do that. But what the Stripe CLI does is it creates this little backdoor that allows Stripe to communicate with your local development. So you're going to want to install this before you can move on. So let's go ahead and type this, just copy it. It's going to open up the browser. And here I'm going to pick my test site here. So allow access. All right, so now we're configured. That's good. Now one thing we're going to need is this uses Postgres, which you can get access to inside of SuperBase. So typically people use SuperBase, or it's very popular to use SuperBase and use its authentication. This particular framework does not use the SuperBase authentication. But we can use SuperBase just to get our database, our Postgres database. So we'll walk through this step here and see what it's asking. It's going to install a couple of packages. So we'll go ahead and let it do that. We want to use local Postgres instance with Docker. Let's use a remote. So in order to do this, we're going to jump over to SuperBase. So basically they're saying, do you want to run Postgres locally on your computer? Which you could do. But because people are going to want to deploy these, I'm going to just go ahead and set up SuperBase so you would know how to do that. Create a new project, project name. We'll go ahead and use this password. I'm going to save it just so I have it. So once the project is created, we'll have all the environment variables we need for these questions here. So it's asking for the Postgres URL. So if we come up here to connect, we have the connection strings. And it's asking for the Postgres URL. I'm just going to go ahead and give it this whole thing here. I might want it in a different format, but we'll see. And we need to put in the password. So I'm going to jump back here, copy the password. Into your Stripe secret key. So let's jump over to Stripe developers. Manage keys secret key. Copy. Says it's complete. Let's see if these actual commands work. So now it's going to actually do some database stuff. So if this doesn't work, then our database connection was not correct. All right. Host name. So one thing I remember here, Postgres or SuperBase, I think you need to use a transaction polar here, actually. We'll leave you need to use this one here. So let's go back up. DB set up remote. Let's try this one. Got to put the secret key in again. So migrate was the command that we were going to run. All right. There we got the database correct. So that means if we go over to our database, I'm going to assume we've got some tables here. Perfect. Cool. Seed creating Stripe products and prices. Awesome. So now put data into the database. It also created a test user with this information here. So now all we need to do is run. Now, here's what I was talking about before. In order for the payment integration on your local computer to work, you're going to have to run this command. Without getting too complicated, it's going to give away for Stripe to send a webhook back to your website, even when it's running on your computer, which the internet can access. It's going to create kind of a backdoor that allows that to work. And it's really not that complicated. It's just that if you don't know, it's hard. So let's take a look and see how this is working. All right. Cool. I'd say that was pretty simple. And let's test logging in. It doesn't have a log in. So let's go to sign up, sign into existing account. And it's admin123. Sign in. So this is pretty sweet, actually. So you have all of this built out security. Your team, invite members, manage subscriptions. So we have these two subscriptions here. So that makes me think that if I come over to Superbase, we've got these different tables here, activity invitations, teams, users. My guess is that it's using the products inside of our product catalog. Right. So it's getting all of those products straight from Stripe. So if you set these up here, it's going to automatically add them into your SAS here, which is pretty cool. And it does give some testing here. So first and foremost, I'm going to run this. Our terminal, I'm going to create a new window. All right. So now it should be working. So now if I actually go to Stripe and do this, it should work. Let's go ahead and log out, sign up, test123. Sign up. Cool. So I created the account, manage subscription, get started, should go over to Stripe, where we can put in our details. And we have our test card here. And you just have to use something in the future. So we'll go with, I guess, 26 as all we need. And then I'll just put anything for the CSV I believe. Save my information. Just in my email. So this is that process right there where you need the Stripe CLI. So you can see right here, it's doing some magic in the background to allow that transaction to work correctly, even though I'm local on my computer. And now I'm signed up with the new subscription. So that's pretty cool. In terms of frameworks, that's the easiest I've seen to go from nothing to having a complete site with landing page, login and team management and Stripe integration all at once in a pretty easy install. So I'd say that's a success.
