Patterns can be combined: a **Monitor > Detect > Alert** system might trigger an **Issue > Execute > PR** workflow, which internally uses **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** for the heavy lifting.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Scrape > Process > Output\n\n**Summary:** A web scraping pipeline that fetches raw content from one or more URLs via a web-access MCP, processes and structures the data with Python (or Claude itself), and writes clean output to a target destination.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need structured data extracted from websites that lack APIs.\n- You want to convert messy HTML into clean JSON, CSV, or Markdown on a recurring schedule.\n- You are building a dataset from publicly available web content.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Define targets** -- Specify URLs, selectors, or search queries in a config file or workflow input.\n2. **Fetch raw content** -- Use a web MCP (Fetch, Puppeteer, or Playwright) to retrieve page content. Handle pagination if needed.\n3. **Parse and extract** -- Strip irrelevant markup. Pull target fields using CSS selectors, XPath, or Claude-driven semantic extraction.\n4. **Transform** -- Normalize data types, deduplicate, validate schema. Python scripts or inline Claude processing.\n5. **Output** -- Write results to a file in the repo (`data/`, `output/`), post to an API, or commit as a structured artifact.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP** -- lightweight HTTP retrieval, returns Markdown-converted content.\n- **Puppeteer / Playwright MCP** -- for JavaScript-rendered pages requiring a headless browser.\n- **Python** -- pandas, BeautifulSoup, or custom scripts for heavy transformation.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- write results to disk.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 6 * * *'   # daily at 06:00 UTC\n  workflow_dispatch:        # manual trigger\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Scrape competitor pricing pages nightly; output a CSV diff showing changes.\n- Collect job postings from three sites; normalize into a single JSON feed committed to the repo.\n- Pull public government data tables and convert to machine-readable Parquet files.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Retry with backoff** on transient HTTP errors (429, 503).\n- **Schema validation** after extraction -- if required fields are missing, flag the record rather than silently dropping it.\n- **Stale-data guard** -- if fetch returns identical content to last run, skip processing and log \"no change.\"\n- **Alert on structural change** -- if selectors return zero matches (site redesign), open a GitHub Issue for human review.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Research > Analyze > Report\n\n**Summary:** A multi-source research workflow that gathers information from diverse sources (web, APIs, local files), synthesizes findings with Claude, and produces a formatted report committed to the repository.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need to compile information from multiple sources into a single coherent document.\n- Periodic market research, competitive analysis, or literature reviews.\n- Any task where a human would spend hours reading and summarizing.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Define research brief** -- Specify the topic, questions to answer, source priorities, and output format.\n2. **Gather sources** -- Query web search, fetch specific URLs, read local reference files, call APIs.\n3. **Extract key findings** -- For each source, pull relevant facts, quotes, data points. Tag each with provenance.\n4. **Analyze and synthesize** -- Claude cross-references findings, identifies patterns, contradictions, and gaps.\n5. **Generate report** -- Produce a structured Markdown document with sections, citations, and an executive summary.\n6. **Commit and notify** -- Commit the report to the repo. Optionally open a PR or send a notification.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Web Search MCP / Fetch MCP** -- gather online sources.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read local reference documents.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit output, open issues or PRs.\n- **Claude (extended thinking)** -- deep analysis and synthesis.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'   # weekly on Monday at 09:00 UTC\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      topic:\n        description: 'Research topic'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Weekly competitive landscape report that tracks new features announced by three competitors.\n- Monthly technology radar summarizing emerging tools relevant to the team's stack.\n- Ad-hoc deep-dive report triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch` with a topic input.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Source fallback** -- if a primary source is unreachable, log it and proceed with remaining sources. Note gaps in the report.\n- **Confidence scoring** -- Claude flags low-confidence claims; the report includes a \"Caveats\" section.\n- **Minimum-source threshold** -- if fewer than N sources are successfully retrieved, abort and open an issue rather than publishing a thin report.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Monitor > Detect > Alert\n\n**Summary:** A continuous monitoring system that periodically checks a target (website, API, dataset, repo) for changes, applies detection logic, and fires alerts or triggers downstream workflows when significant changes are found.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want to be notified when something changes: a webpage, an API response, a competitor's pricing, a regulatory filing.\n- You need a lightweight, Git-native alternative to commercial monitoring SaaS.\n- Ideal for cron-triggered GitHub Actions that run on a schedule.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Fetch current state** -- Retrieve the current snapshot of the monitored target.\n2. **Load previous state** -- Read the last-known state from a file committed in the repo (e.g., `state/last_snapshot.json`).\n3. **Diff** -- Compare current vs. previous. Use structural diff for JSON, text diff for prose, hash comparison for binary.\n4. **Evaluate significance** -- Apply rules or Claude-based judgment to determine if the change is meaningful (filter noise).\n5. **Alert** -- If significant: open a GitHub Issue, send a Slack message, trigger a downstream workflow via `repository_dispatch`, or all three.\n6. **Persist new state** -- Commit the current snapshot as the new baseline.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP / Puppeteer MCP** -- retrieve current state from web targets.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write state files.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- open issues, trigger dispatches.\n- **Slack MCP** -- send alert messages.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '*/30 * * * *'  # every 30 minutes\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Monitor a government regulatory page for new filings; alert the legal team via Slack when a new document appears.\n- Watch a competitor's changelog page; open a GitHub Issue summarizing each detected update.\n- Track an API's response schema for breaking changes; alert the engineering team.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Transient failure tolerance** -- if the fetch fails, do NOT overwrite previous state. Log the failure. After N consecutive failures, escalate to an alert.\n- **False-positive suppression** -- use Claude to evaluate whether a detected \"change\" is meaningful (e.g., ignore timestamp-only diffs).\n- **State corruption recovery** -- if state file is missing or unparseable, re-initialize from scratch and log a warning instead of crashing.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Intake > Enrich > Deliver\n\n**Summary:** A data enrichment pipeline that receives raw input (from a form, webhook, file drop, or API), augments it with additional data from external sources, and delivers the enriched result to its destination.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- Incoming data is incomplete and needs augmentation before it is useful.\n- You are building a lead enrichment, content tagging, or metadata enhancement system.\n- Raw data arrives in one format and must be transformed and enriched before storage or delivery.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Intake** -- Receive raw data. Sources: webhook payload, new file in repo, manual trigger with JSON input, or a watched directory.\n2. **Validate** -- Check that required fields exist and data types are correct. Reject malformed input early.\n3. **Enrich** -- For each record, call enrichment sources: web search for context, APIs for supplementary data, Claude for classification or summarization.\n4. **Merge** -- Combine original data with enrichment results into a unified schema.\n5. **Deliver** -- Write enriched data to its destination: commit to repo, POST to API, append to a dataset file, or open a PR.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Web Search MCP** -- find supplementary information.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- call enrichment APIs.\n- **Claude** -- classify, tag, summarize, or score records.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read input, write output.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit results or open PRs.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'inbox/**'          # new file dropped in inbox\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      payload:\n        description: 'JSON data to enrich'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- A sales team drops a CSV of company names into `inbox/`; the pipeline enriches each with industry, size, website, and LinkedIn URL, then writes to `data/enriched_leads.csv`.\n- Incoming support tickets are enriched with customer history and sentiment score before routing.\n- Raw RSS feed items are enriched with summaries, topic tags, and relevance scores.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Per-record error isolation** -- if enrichment fails for one record, mark it as `enrichment_failed` and continue processing the rest. Do not let one bad record kill the batch.\n- **Rate-limit awareness** -- track API call counts; pause and retry when rate-limited rather than failing fast.\n- **Partial delivery** -- deliver successfully enriched records on schedule; queue failed records for retry in the next run.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Generate > Review > Publish\n\n**Summary:** A content generation pipeline with built-in quality gates. Claude generates draft content, a review step validates quality and compliance, and approved content is published to its destination.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- Automated content creation (blog posts, documentation, social media, release notes) where quality must be verified before publishing.\n- Any workflow where you want a \"human-in-the-loop\" approval step or an automated quality check before output goes live.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Brief** -- Define the content requirements: topic, audience, tone, length, format, and any reference material.\n2. **Generate** -- Claude produces a first draft using the brief and any provided reference material.\n3. **Automated review** -- Run quality checks: spelling/grammar, factual consistency against source material, tone analysis, compliance rules (e.g., no prohibited claims).\n4. **Gate decision** -- If automated review passes, proceed. If it fails, loop back to step 2 with feedback (max N retries). Optionally, require human approval via a PR review.\n5. **Publish** -- Commit final content to the repo, deploy to a CMS via API, or post to a platform.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Claude** -- generation and review (use separate system prompts for generator vs. reviewer to create genuine separation).\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read briefs, write drafts and final output.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- open a draft PR for human review; merge on approval.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- publish to external CMS or platform APIs.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [labeled]        # label \"content-request\" triggers generation\n  pull_request_review:\n    types: [submitted]      # human approval triggers publish\n  workflow_dispatch:\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Weekly changelog: gather merged PRs, generate a formatted changelog, open a PR for team review, publish on approval.\n- Blog post pipeline: issue labeled \"draft-request\" triggers generation; editor reviews the PR; merge triggers deployment.\n- Social media batch: generate a week's worth of posts, run brand-voice review, output approved posts to a scheduling queue.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Retry budget** -- if automated review rejects the draft, regenerate with targeted feedback up to 3 times. After that, escalate to a human by opening an issue.\n- **Rollback on publish failure** -- if the publish step fails (API error), keep the approved content in the repo and log the failure for manual retry.\n- **Diff guard** -- before publishing, diff against previously published content to prevent accidental overwrite of manual edits.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Listen > Decide > Act\n\n**Summary:** An event-driven agent that listens for incoming events (webhooks, GitHub events, messages), applies decision logic to determine the appropriate response, and takes autonomous action.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need a system that reacts to external events in near-real-time.\n- Webhook-triggered GitHub Actions are the execution engine.\n- The appropriate response depends on the content of the event (routing, triage, conditional logic).\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Receive event** -- GitHub Actions triggers on the event (webhook, issue creation, PR comment, `repository_dispatch`).\n2. **Parse and classify** -- Extract relevant data from the event payload. Use Claude to classify intent or severity if the input is unstructured (e.g., natural language).\n3. **Decide** -- Apply decision logic: rule-based routing, Claude-driven triage, or a lookup table. Determine which action(s) to take.\n4. **Act** -- Execute the chosen action: respond to the issue, trigger another workflow, call an API, update a file, or escalate to a human.\n5. **Log** -- Record the event, decision, and action taken for auditability.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **GitHub MCP** -- read event payloads, respond to issues/PRs, trigger dispatches.\n- **Claude** -- classify, triage, and decide.\n- **Slack MCP** -- notify humans when escalation is needed.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- call external APIs as part of the action.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened, labeled]\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [incoming_webhook]\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Triage bot: new issues are classified by Claude (bug, feature, question) and auto-labeled, assigned, and replied to with relevant templates.\n- Deployment gatekeeper: a PR comment like \"/deploy staging\" triggers a deployment workflow after validating the commenter's permissions.\n- Customer feedback router: webhook delivers feedback; Claude scores sentiment and routes critical items to Slack.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Idempotency** -- design actions to be safe to retry. Use event IDs to detect and skip duplicate deliveries.\n- **Decision logging** -- log the full decision chain (event > classification > decision > action) so failures can be diagnosed.\n- **Safe defaults** -- if classification confidence is low, default to escalation (notify a human) rather than taking an autonomous action that might be wrong.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Collect > Transform > Store\n\n**Summary:** A classic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline where Git serves as the data store. Data is collected from external sources, transformed into a canonical format, and committed to the repository as versioned, queryable files.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want a version-controlled data lake without standing up a database.\n- Small-to-medium datasets (tens of MB) that benefit from Git's diff, history, and branching.\n- Data pipelines where auditability and reproducibility matter more than query speed.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Collect** -- Pull data from source(s): APIs, web scrapes, file uploads, other repos.\n2. **Validate** -- Check data integrity: schema validation, null checks, type enforcement.\n3. **Transform** -- Normalize, clean, reshape. Convert to the canonical schema. Deduplicate against existing data in the store.\n4. **Diff** -- Compare transformed data against the current version in the repo. Compute what is new, changed, or deleted.\n5. **Store** -- Commit the updated dataset files to the repo. Use meaningful commit messages describing what changed (e.g., \"Add 14 new records from source X\").\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP** -- pull data from APIs and web sources.\n- **Python** -- pandas or custom scripts for transformation.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write data files.\n- **GitHub MCP / Git CLI** -- commit, push, branch as needed.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # every 6 hours\n  workflow_dispatch:\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Collect cryptocurrency prices from three APIs every 6 hours; store as daily CSV files in `data/prices/`.\n- Pull open government datasets weekly; transform into a normalized schema; maintain a living dataset in the repo.\n- Aggregate internal metrics from multiple microservice health endpoints; store as JSON for a dashboard.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Atomic commits** -- only commit if the entire pipeline succeeds. Never commit partial or corrupted data.\n- **Schema drift detection** -- if source data no longer matches the expected schema, abort and alert rather than storing malformed data.\n- **Rollback via Git** -- if bad data is committed, revert the commit. The previous state is always recoverable.\n- **Dedup safety** -- idempotent writes ensure that re-running the pipeline does not create duplicate records.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Fan-Out > Process > Merge\n\n**Summary:** The Agent Teams pattern. A coordinator agent splits a large task into independent sub-tasks, dispatches them to parallel sub-agents (or sequential iterations), collects all results, and merges them into a unified output.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- A task is naturally decomposable into independent units of work (e.g., process each file, research each topic, analyze each competitor).\n- You want to reduce wall-clock time by parallelizing work.\n- The final deliverable requires combining results from multiple sub-tasks.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Plan** -- The coordinator analyzes the task and determines how to decompose it. Produces a work manifest: a list of sub-tasks with their inputs.\n2. **Fan-Out** -- Dispatch each sub-task. Options: parallel GitHub Actions jobs via a matrix strategy, sequential Claude tool calls, or `repository_dispatch` events to separate workflows.\n3. **Process** -- Each sub-agent executes its sub-task independently. Results are written to a known location (e.g., `temp/results/task_01.json`).\n4. **Collect** -- The coordinator waits for all sub-tasks to complete and gathers their outputs.\n5. **Merge** -- Combine results: concatenate, deduplicate, reconcile conflicts, and produce the final unified output.\n6. **Deliver** -- Commit the merged output or pass it to the next stage in a larger pipeline.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Claude** -- coordinator logic, sub-task execution, merge logic.\n- **GitHub Actions matrix** -- parallel job execution.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write intermediate and final results.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- coordinate via issues, artifacts, or dispatch events.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      task_manifest:\n        description: 'JSON array of sub-tasks'\n        required: true\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [fan_out_request]\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Analyze 20 competitor websites: fan out one sub-agent per competitor, each produces a profile, merge into a single competitive analysis report.\n- Process a batch of 50 documents: each sub-agent summarizes one document, merge into a master summary with cross-references.\n- Multi-language translation: fan out one sub-agent per target language, merge all translations into a localized content bundle.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Partial success tolerance** -- if some sub-tasks fail, merge the successful results and report failures. Do not discard all work because of one failure.\n- **Retry failed sub-tasks** -- the coordinator can re-dispatch failed sub-tasks up to N times before giving up.\n- **Timeout enforcement** -- set a maximum wall-clock time for the fan-out phase. Collect whatever is done when the timer expires.\n- **Conflict resolution** -- if sub-task results conflict, the merge step uses Claude to reconcile or flags the conflict for human review.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Issue > Execute > PR\n\n**Summary:** The GitHub Agent HQ pattern. An agent receives a task specification via a GitHub Issue, autonomously executes the required workflow, and delivers the results as a draft Pull Request for human review.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want a human-in-the-loop task queue where work is requested via Issues and delivered via PRs.\n- The agent should be fully autonomous in execution but the output requires human approval before merging.\n- Building an internal tool where non-technical stakeholders can request work by opening an Issue.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Receive** -- A new Issue is opened (or an existing Issue is labeled with a trigger label like `agent-task`). GitHub Actions fires.\n2. **Parse task** -- Claude reads the Issue body and extracts the task specification: what to do, inputs, constraints, expected output.\n3. **Create branch** -- Create a feature branch named after the Issue (e.g., `agent/issue-42`).\n4. **Execute** -- Run the appropriate workflow or pattern to complete the task. This might invoke any other pattern in this catalog.\n5. **Commit results** -- Commit all output files to the feature branch with clear commit messages.\n6. **Open draft PR** -- Open a draft PR linked to the original Issue. The PR body includes a summary of what was done, key decisions made, and anything that needs human attention.\n7. **Comment on Issue** -- Post a comment on the Issue linking to the PR and summarizing the outcome.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **GitHub MCP** -- read issues, create branches, commit, open PRs, post comments.\n- **Claude** -- parse task, execute logic, generate summaries.\n- **Any other MCP** -- depending on the task being executed.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened, labeled]\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]       # support \"/execute\" command in comments\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- A product manager opens an Issue: \"Research top 5 CRM tools and compare features.\" The agent researches, builds a comparison table, and opens a PR with the report.\n- An engineer opens an Issue: \"Add unit tests for the auth module.\" The agent generates tests and delivers them as a PR.\n- A stakeholder opens an Issue: \"Update the pricing page data for Q1.\" The agent pulls new data, updates the files, and opens a PR for review.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Status updates** -- the agent comments on the Issue at each major step (\"Starting research...\", \"Generating report...\", \"Opening PR...\") so progress is visible.\n- **Graceful failure** -- if the agent cannot complete the task, it comments on the Issue with a clear explanation of what went wrong and what it tried, then labels the Issue `agent-failed` for human triage.\n- **Scope guard** -- if Claude determines the task is ambiguous or out of scope, it asks a clarifying question in the Issue comments rather than guessing.\n- **Draft-only PRs** -- all PRs are opened as drafts. The agent never merges its own work.\n\n---\n\n## 10. n8n Import > Translate > Deploy\n\n**Summary:** A conversion pattern that ingests an n8n workflow JSON export, translates it into a WAT-native system (Claude Code + MCP + GitHub Actions), and deploys it as a fully functional GitHub-native workflow.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You are migrating from n8n (or a similar visual workflow tool) to a GitHub-native architecture.\n- You want to leverage existing workflow logic without manually rewriting it.\n- You are evaluating whether an n8n workflow can run as a WAT system to reduce infrastructure dependencies.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Import** -- Read the n8n workflow JSON file. This contains nodes, connections, credentials references, and configuration.\n2. **Parse and map** -- Walk the node graph. For each n8n node type, identify the equivalent WAT component:\n   - HTTP Request node -> Fetch MCP call\n   - Code (JavaScript/Python) node -> inline script or Python file\n   - IF/Switch node -> Claude decision logic or conditional in workflow\n   - Webhook trigger -> `repository_dispatch` or `workflow_dispatch`\n   - Cron trigger -> `schedule` trigger in GitHub Actions\n   - Set/Merge nodes -> data transformation in Claude or Python\n3. **Translate** -- Generate the WAT system files:\n   - `.github/workflows/*.yml` -- GitHub Actions workflow definition.\n   - `prompts/` -- Claude system prompts for nodes that require AI logic.\n   - `scripts/` -- Python or shell scripts for code nodes.\n   - `config/` -- Configuration extracted from the n8n workflow.\n4. **Validate** -- Dry-run the generated workflow. Check that all node types were mapped, no credentials are hardcoded, and the control flow is correct.\n5. **Deploy** -- Commit the generated files to the repo. Open a PR with a detailed summary of the translation, noting any nodes that required manual review or could not be auto-translated.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read n8n JSON, write generated files.\n- **Claude** -- interpret node logic, generate prompts, translate code, produce workflow YAML.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit files, open PR.\n- **Python** -- parse n8n JSON, generate boilerplate.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'imports/n8n/*.json'   # drop an n8n export to trigger conversion\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      n8n_file:\n        description: 'Path to n8n JSON file in the repo'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Migrate a 15-node n8n lead-scoring workflow to a Git-versioned, GitHub Actions-powered system.\n- Convert an n8n social media posting pipeline into a WAT **Generate > Review > Publish** system.\n- Translate an n8n monitoring workflow into a WAT **Monitor > Detect > Alert** pattern, eliminating the need for a running n8n instance.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Unsupported node catalog** -- maintain a list of n8n node types that cannot be auto-translated. When encountered, flag them in the PR description with a `TODO` and a suggested manual implementation.\n- **Credential safety** -- never translate credentials. Replace all credential references with GitHub Secrets placeholders (`${{ secrets.SERVICE_API_KEY }}`) and document which secrets need to be configured.\n- **Fidelity check** -- generate a side-by-side comparison of the n8n flow and the translated WAT flow so a human reviewer can verify correctness.\n- **Incremental migration** -- support translating a subset of the n8n workflow, allowing teams to migrate node-by-node rather than all-at-once.\n\n---\n\n## Pattern Composition Quick Reference\n\nPatterns are building blocks. Here are common compositions:\n\n| Composition | How It Works |\n|---|---|\n| **Monitor > Detect > Alert** + **Issue > Execute > PR** | Monitor detects a change, opens an Issue, which triggers the agent to act and deliver a PR. |\n| **Issue > Execute > PR** using **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** | A complex Issue task is decomposed and parallelized internally before the PR is opened. |\n| **Scrape > Process > Output** feeding **Collect > Transform > Store** | Scraping output is piped into the ETL pattern for versioned storage. |\n| **Listen > Decide > Act** routing to any pattern | An event-driven dispatcher that selects and triggers the appropriate pattern based on the event. |\n| **n8n Import > Translate > Deploy** producing any pattern | The translator identifies which WAT pattern best fits the n8n workflow and generates accordingly. |\n\n---\n\n## Choosing a Pattern\n\n| Question | Recommended Pattern |\n|---|---|\n| Do I need to pull data from websites? | **Scrape > Process > Output** |\n| Do I need to synthesize information from many sources? | **Research > Analyze > Report** |\n| Do I need to watch for changes over time? | **Monitor > Detect > Alert** |\n| Do I need to augment incoming data? | **Intake > Enrich > Deliver** |\n| Do I need AI-generated content with quality control? | **Generate > Review > Publish** |\n| Do I need to react to external events? | **Listen > Decide > Act** |\n| Do I need versioned data storage without a database? | **Collect > Transform > Store** |\n| Do I need to parallelize a large task? | **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** |\n| Do I need a task queue with human approval? | **Issue > Execute > PR** |\n| Do I need to migrate an n8n workflow? | **n8n Import > Translate > Deploy** |\n| Do I need B2B lead generation from web data? | **Intake > Enrich > Deliver** (lead-gen variant) |\n\n---\n\n## Proven Compositions (from builds)\n\n### Lead Generation Pipeline (lead-gen-machine)\n- **Pattern**: Intake > Enrich > Deliver + Scrape > Process > Output\n- **Flow**: Parse profile > Search web > Scrape sites > Extract contacts (Claude) > Score leads > Output CSV\n- **Key insight**: The Intake > Enrich > Deliver pattern works well when the \"enrichment\" involves multi-step web scraping + AI extraction. Each company is an independent unit of work, making this a strong candidate for Fan-Out > Process > Merge parallelization.\n- **Scoring pattern**: Decompose match criteria into independent dimensions (industry, size, location, keywords) with weighted point values. This makes the scoring transparent and tunable.\n- **Fallback chains**: Firecrawl > HTTP+BeautifulSoup for scraping, Claude > regex for extraction. Always have a degraded-but-functional fallback.\n\n### Marketing Pipeline (marketing-pipeline)\n- **Pattern**: Intake > Enrich > Deliver + Generate > Review > Publish\n- **Flow**: Ingest CSV > Enrich via Apollo/Hunter/Brave/Claude > Deep-score (5 dimensions) > Segment (Hot/Warm/Cold) > Generate outreach (Hot) > Generate nurture (Warm) > Output CSVs + emails\n- **Key insight**: Multi-API enrichment with graceful degradation. Apollo (primary) > Hunter (email verification) > Brave (research) > Claude (pain analysis). Each API layer adds value but the system works with only Anthropic API.\n- **Scoring pattern**: 5-dimension scoring (size fit, tech stack compatibility, budget signals, accessibility, pain signals) with transparent point breakdown. More dimensions = more nuanced than lead-gen-machine's 4-dimension approach.\n- **Content generation pattern**: Outreach and nurture are independent post-segmentation, making them natural Agent Teams candidates. Outreach is per-lead personalized; nurture is aggregate-informed.\n- **API fallback chain**: Apollo > Hunter > Brave > Claude > HTTP scraping. Four-level fallback with clear degradation at each level.\n- **CSV-in/CSV-out**: Accepts CSV input (compatible with lead-gen-machine output), produces segmented CSVs + markdown email sequences. Easy to chain systems.\n\n### Website Uptime Monitor (website-uptime-monitor)\n- **Pattern**: Monitor > Log (simplified from Monitor > Detect > Alert)\n- **Flow**: Check URL via HTTP GET > Measure response time > Determine up/down status > Append to CSV > Commit to Git\n- **Key insight**: Simplest possible monitoring system - no detection logic, no alerting, just raw data collection. Every check produces a log entry regardless of status. Git history IS the audit trail.\n- **No MCPs needed**: Direct Python `requests` library is simpler and more reliable than Fetch MCP for a single GET request. CSV append uses stdlib. Zero external dependencies beyond GitHub Actions.\n- **Exit code signaling**: Tool exits 0 if up, 1 if down - GitHub Actions UI shows workflow as \"failed\" when site is down, providing at-a-glance status without additional alerting logic.\n- **Concurrency handling**: GitHub Actions `concurrency` setting prevents simultaneous runs. Git push includes retry with rebase to handle rare concurrent commits.\n- **CSV as database**: Append-only CSV committed to Git provides versioned, auditable, queryable dataset. No external database needed. Git handles MB-scale data easily.\n- **Cron variance accepted**: GitHub Actions cron has ±5 minute variance - documented as expected behavior rather than a bug to fix.\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) Scheduled cron (primary), (2) Manual dispatch (testing), (3) Local CLI (development). Agent HQ (4) optional for issue-driven tasks.\n- **Cost awareness**: ~1,440 GitHub Actions minutes/month for 5-minute checks. Fits within free tier (2,000/month private, unlimited public).\n- **Extensibility points**: Add alerting by extending monitor.yml (Slack webhook, GitHub Issue). Add multiple URLs via matrix strategy or separate workflows. Add authentication via tool arguments + GitHub Secrets.\n\n### CSV-to-JSON Converter (csv-to-json-converter)\n- **Pattern**: Collect > Transform > Store\n- **Flow**: Collect CSV files > Analyze structure > Parse CSV > Infer types > Validate data > Convert to JSON/JSONL > Generate reports > Commit\n- **Key insight**: Multi-phase transformation with specialist subagents. Each phase (analyze, infer, validate, write) has a dedicated subagent with focused responsibilities. Main agent orchestrates the pipeline.\n- **Subagent architecture**: Four specialist subagents (csv-analyzer, type-inference-specialist, data-validator, json-writer) with minimal tool access. Subagents are the DEFAULT delegation mechanism, not Agent Teams.\n- **Type inference pattern**: Statistical analysis with confidence scoring (80% threshold). Detects int, float, boolean, datetime, string. Falls back to string for ambiguous columns. Handles 10+ null value representations.\n- **Encoding detection**: chardet for automatic encoding detection with UTF-8 fallback. Strips BOM (byte order mark) automatically. Supports UTF-8, Latin-1, Windows-1252, etc.\n- **Ragged row handling**: Pad short rows with null, truncate long rows with warning. Log all issues in validation report but continue processing (graceful degradation).\n- **Validation without failure**: Validator NEVER raises exceptions. Always returns a report. Strict mode controls whether issues halt the pipeline, but validation itself is fail-safe.\n- **JSONL streaming**: For large files (1M+ rows), JSONL format writes one record at a time. No array wrapper. Memory-efficient for multi-GB datasets.\n- **Batch processing modes**: Sequential (1-2 files) or parallel (3+ files with Agent Teams). Parallel is 5x faster wall time but same token cost. Always has sequential fallback.\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) CLI for local development, (2) GitHub Actions for production, (3) Agent HQ for issue-driven tasks. All three produce identical output.\n- **Metadata reporting**: run_summary.json (machine-readable) + validation_report.md (human-readable). Includes per-file stats, type inference results, validation issues, recommendations.\n- **No secrets required**: Uses only stdlib (csv, json, pathlib) + chardet + python-dateutil. No external APIs. Pure data transformation pipeline.\n- **Git commit discipline**: Stage ONLY output files (never `git add -A`). Commit message includes file count, row count, timestamp. Output directory is parameterized.\n\n### RSS Digest Monitor (rss-digest-monitor)\n- **Pattern**: Monitor > Collect > Transform > Deliver (with state persistence)\n- **Flow**: Load state > Fetch RSS feeds > Filter new posts > Generate HTML digest > Send email > Update state > Commit\n- **Key insight**: State persistence in Git prevents post duplication across runs. Composite GUID keys (feed_url::guid) prevent false deduplication. State is ONLY updated after successful email delivery, ensuring retry on failure.\n- **Subagent architecture**: Three specialist subagents (rss-fetcher-specialist, digest-generator-specialist, state-manager-specialist). Subagents are the DEFAULT delegation mechanism. Sequential execution is correct due to clear data dependencies.\n- **Per-feed error isolation**: One failed feed does NOT kill the entire run. Each feed is fetched independently with try/except. Failed feeds are logged and skipped. Graceful degradation ensures partial success.\n- **Composite GUID pattern**: Use `feed_url::entry_guid` as deduplication key instead of guid alone. Prevents false positives when different feeds use the same GUID format.\n- **State file size management**: Enforce maximum 10,000 GUIDs by keeping most recent entries. Prevents unbounded state growth. Log warning if limit is hit.\n- **Email with fallback**: MIME multipart with HTML primary and plain-text fallback. Ensures compatibility with all email clients. HTML is styled with inline CSS for maximum rendering support.\n- **Conditional email send**: Skip email generation if no new posts found. Silent run with state update only. Saves API calls and prevents empty emails.\n- **SMTP retry logic**: Retry once with 30s delay on transient failures (auth, network, timeout). Do NOT update state if email send fails -- posts retry on next run.\n- **First-run initialization**: Missing or corrupted state file initializes empty state. All posts are processed on first run. Log warning but continue (better to duplicate once than crash).\n- **Date parsing with fallback**: Use python-dateutil for robust parsing of varied date formats. If unparseable, use current timestamp. Include post anyway (better to duplicate than miss).\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) Scheduled cron at 8 AM UTC (primary), (2) Manual dispatch with force_send (testing), (3) Local CLI (development). All produce identical output.\n- **Run summary logging**: Each run produces `logs/YYYY-MM-DD_run.json` with feeds_checked, feeds_failed, new_posts, email_sent, failed_feeds array. Machine-readable audit trail.\n- **Git commit discipline**: Stage ONLY state/rss_state.json and logs/*.json. NEVER `git add -A`. Commit message includes date and post count for easy history review.\n- **No MCP dependencies**: Uses standard Python libraries (feedparser, smtplib, json, pathlib). Works out-of-the-box with only Python and requirements.txt. No external MCPs required.\n- **Cost awareness**: ~3-5 minutes per day = ~90-150 GitHub Actions minutes/month. Well within free tier (2,000/month private, unlimited public). Minimal token cost for state management only.\n\n## 11. Content Transformation with Tone Matching\n\n**Summary:** An AI-powered content repurposing pipeline that extracts content from a source URL, analyzes its tone and style, and generates platform-optimized variants (social media, email, etc.) that match the source tone automatically.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need to publish the same content across multiple platforms with different format requirements\n- Content must maintain consistent voice/tone across all platforms\n- Manual reformatting for each platform is time-consuming and error-prone\n- You want AI to handle platform-specific best practices (character limits, hashtags, formatting)\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Fetch source content** -- Scrape the source URL (blog post, article) and extract clean text/markdown. Use Firecrawl with HTTP fallback for reliability.\n2. **Analyze tone** -- Use LLM (Claude) with structured output to analyze writing style across multiple dimensions: formality, technical level, humor, primary emotion. Return confidence score.\n3. **Generate platform variants (parallel)** -- For each target platform (Twitter, LinkedIn, email, Instagram):\n   - Send source content + tone analysis to LLM\n   - Request platform-optimized output matching source tone\n   - Enforce platform-specific constraints (char limits, hashtag counts, formatting rules)\n   - Validate character counts before accepting output\n4. **Merge and output** -- Combine all variants into single JSON file with metadata, tone analysis, and all platform content\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Firecrawl MCP** -- reliable web scraping with JS rendering support\n- **Anthropic MCP** -- Claude for tone analysis and content generation\n- **HTTP + BeautifulSoup** -- fallback scraping if Firecrawl unavailable\n- **Python stdlib** -- JSON manipulation, filename slugification, output assembly\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      blog_url:\n        description: 'Blog post URL to repurpose'\n        required: true\n  # Can also be triggered on new blog post detection via RSS or webhook\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Marketing team publishes a blog post, wants Twitter thread, LinkedIn post, email newsletter section, and Instagram caption\n- Content creator wants to maximize reach by publishing same content on all major platforms\n- Agency needs to repurpose client blog posts for multi-channel campaigns\n- Developer advocates want to turn technical blog posts into social-friendly content\n\n### Subagent Architecture\n\n- **content-scraper-specialist** -- Handles web scraping with fallback strategies\n- **tone-analyzer-specialist** -- Analyzes source content tone/style\n- **content-generator-specialist** -- Coordinates multi-platform generation (can use Agent Teams for parallelization)\n- **output-assembler-specialist** -- Merges all content into final JSON\n\n### Agent Teams Parallelization\n\nPlatform generation is ideal for Agent Teams:\n- 4 independent platform generation tasks (Twitter, LinkedIn, email, Instagram)\n- Each takes 10-15 seconds sequentially = 40-55s total\n- Parallel execution with 4 teammates = 12-18s\n- **2x speedup** with identical results and same token cost\n\n### Platform-Specific Constraints\n\n| Platform | Char Limit | Hashtags | Format Notes |\n|----------|------------|----------|--------------|\n| Twitter | 280 per tweet | 2-3 per thread | Numbered thread (1/N format), hook in first tweet, CTA in last |\n| LinkedIn | 3000 max, 1300 target | 3-5 | Professional tone, hook before \"see more\" fold, line breaks |\n| Email | 500-800 words | N/A | Subject line (40-60 chars), scannable format, HTML + plain text |\n| Instagram | 2200 max | 10-15 | Casual tone, emojis (3-5), line breaks, hook before \"more\" button |\n\n### Tone Matching Pattern\n\n1. LLM analyzes source content with structured JSON schema\n2. Returns tone profile: {formality, technical_level, humor_level, primary_emotion, confidence}\n3. Platform generators receive tone profile in their prompts\n4. Each generator adjusts output style to match source tone (formal → formal, casual → casual)\n5. Result: All platforms sound like they were written by the same person\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Scraping failure** -- Halt workflow immediately (no content = can't proceed). Log clear error about paywall/404/timeout.\n- **Tone analysis failure** -- Return default neutral profile, continue with warning. Quality slightly reduced but system remains functional.\n- **Single platform failure** -- Continue with other platforms. Include error structure for failed platform in output. Partial success is acceptable.\n- **Character limit exceeded** -- Tools automatically truncate with \"...\" and log warning. Better than crashing.\n\n### Performance & Cost\n\n**Execution time**:\n- Sequential: ~52-74 seconds\n- With Agent Teams: ~25-37 seconds (2x faster)\n\n**API cost per run** (Claude Sonnet 4):\n- Scraping: $0.01-0.02 (Firecrawl)\n- LLM calls: ~$0.09 (tone + 4 platforms)\n- **Total: ~$0.10-0.11 per blog post**\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n✅ Source content extracted (≥ 100 chars)\n✅ Tone analysis returns confidence ≥ 0.5\n✅ At least 2/4 platforms generate successfully\n✅ All character counts within platform limits\n✅ Output JSON file written to repo\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n- **Tone matching is powerful** -- AI can accurately replicate writing style when given structured tone analysis\n- **Parallel generation scales well** -- 4 independent LLM calls are perfect for Agent Teams\n- **Character validation is critical** -- Must validate before returning, not after\n- **Partial success is acceptable** -- 3/4 platforms working is better than all-or-nothing\n- **Firecrawl + fallback pattern works** -- Primary API with HTTP backup maximizes reliability\n- **Subagent specialization reduces complexity** -- Each subagent has clear, scoped responsibility\n\n### Related Patterns\n\nCombines elements of:\n- **Scrape > Process > Output** (content extraction)\n- **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** (parallel platform generation via Agent Teams)\n- **Generate > Review > Publish** (content creation with validation)\n\n## 12. Sequential State Management Pipeline\n\n**Summary:** A data transformation pipeline that maintains persistent state across runs using atomic file operations. Each execution reads current state, transforms data, generates output, updates state, and commits results -- all while preventing race conditions.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need sequential numbering or versioning that persists across workflow runs\n- Output depends on previous runs (counters, IDs, sequence numbers)\n- Concurrent execution must not create duplicates\n- State must survive container/server restarts\n- Git-native state storage is preferred over external databases\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Read State** -- Load previous state from committed file\n2. **Lock State** -- Acquire file lock to prevent concurrent modifications\n3. **Transform Data** -- Process input using current state\n4. **Update State** -- Increment counter, add ID, update version\n5. **Generate Output** -- Produce artifacts using updated state\n6. **Commit State** -- Write state file and outputs to repo\n7. **Release Lock** -- Allow next execution to proceed\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **filelock** (Python) -- Atomic file locking with timeout\n- **Git** -- State file versioning and recovery\n- **filesystem MCP** -- Read/write state files\n- **JSON** (stdlib) -- State serialization\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      data:\n        description: 'Input data to process'\n        required: true\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'input/**'\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Invoice generator with sequential invoice numbers (INV-1001, INV-1002...)\n- Document versioning system (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0...)\n- Sequential ID assignment for records\n- Incrementing batch job numbers\n- Auto-incrementing PR numbers in custom systems\n\n### State File Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"last_value\": 1042,\n  \"prefix\": \"INV-\",\n  \"padding\": 4,\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"last_updated\": \"2026-02-11T14:30:00Z\",\n    \"total_count\": 1042\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Atomic Operations Pattern\n\n```python\nfrom filelock import FileLock, Timeout\n\nlock_path = f\"{state_file}.lock\"\ntry:\n    with FileLock(lock_path, timeout=5):\n        # Read current state\n        state = json.loads(Path(state_file).read_text())\n        \n        # Modify state\n        state[\"last_value\"] += 1\n        \n        # Write updated state\n        Path(state_file).write_text(json.dumps(state, indent=2))\n        \n        # Return new value\n        return state[\"last_value\"]\nexcept Timeout:\n    # Fallback: use timestamp or other unique value\n    return generate_fallback_value()\n```\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n**Lock timeout (5 seconds)**\n- **Cause**: Concurrent execution or filesystem issue\n- **Action**: Use fallback mechanism (timestamp, UUID, or queue for retry)\n- **Log**: Warning with details for investigation\n- **Continue**: Workflow proceeds with fallback value\n\n**State file missing**\n- **Cause**: First run or file deleted\n- **Action**: Initialize to default starting value\n- **Log**: Info message about initialization\n- **Continue**: Normal operation from initial state\n\n**State file corrupted**\n- **Cause**: Incomplete write, manual edit, merge conflict\n- **Action**: Restore from Git history or reinitialize\n- **Log**: Error with corrupted content\n- **Halt**: Require manual intervention (prevents data loss)\n\n**Concurrent modifications**\n- **Prevented by**: File locking ensures only one process modifies at a time\n- **If lock fails**: Fallback prevents workflow failure\n- **Trade-off**: Fallback may break sequential ordering but ensures system continues\n\n### Git-Native State Management\n\nState files are committed to the repository:\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Version history (full audit trail)\n- Rollback capability (`git checkout HEAD~5 state.json`)\n- Merge conflict detection\n- No external database needed\n- Free hosting on GitHub\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Not suitable for high-frequency updates (>100/min)\n- Commit overhead (~1-2 seconds per update)\n- Repo size impact (minimal for small JSON files)\n\n### Fallback Strategies\n\nWhen atomic state update fails, use one of these fallbacks:\n\n| Strategy | When to Use | Trade-off |\n|----------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Timestamp** | Unique value needed, order not critical | Breaks sequential numbering |\n| **UUID** | Unique value needed, no pattern required | No human-readable sequence |\n| **Queue for retry** | Sequential order is critical | Delays processing |\n| **Range allocation** | High concurrency expected | More complex state management |\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**GitHub Actions:**\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Get next value\n    id: state\n    run: |\n      python tools/manage_state.py state.json get_next > output.json\n      VALUE=$(jq -r '.value' output.json)\n      echo \"VALUE=$VALUE\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n  \n  - name: Use value\n    run: |\n      process_data.py --id ${{ steps.state.outputs.VALUE }}\n  \n  - name: Commit state\n    run: |\n      git add state.json output/*\n      git commit -m \"Process ID ${{ steps.state.outputs.VALUE }}\"\n      git push\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- State file exists and is valid JSON\n- Lock acquired within timeout (5 seconds)\n- State incremented correctly\n- Output files reference correct state value\n- State file committed (or queued for commit)\n- Audit trail complete (log entry written)\n\n### Performance Characteristics\n\n- **Lock acquisition**: < 100ms (no contention) to 5s (with contention)\n- **State read/write**: < 50ms (small JSON files)\n- **Git commit**: 1-2 seconds\n- **Total overhead**: 2-7 seconds per execution\n\n**Bottleneck:** Git commit (unavoidable for state persistence)\n\n### Key Learnings (from invoice-generator build)\n\n- **Lock timeout must have fallback** -- Never let locking failure halt the workflow\n- **Initialize on missing file** -- Don't fail on first run\n- **Timestamp fallback works** -- Breaks sequence but ensures uniqueness\n- **Audit log is separate** -- State update and audit logging are independent\n- **State-before-output** -- Update state BEFORE generating output (prevents duplicate detection)\n- **Decimal for currency** -- Use Decimal type when state affects financial calculations\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- **No locking** -- Race conditions create duplicates\n- **Hardcoded initial value** -- Make it configurable\n- **Fail without fallback** -- Lock timeout should not crash the system\n- **Update state after output** -- Output first, then state (wrong order leads to duplicates on failure)\n- **Manual state edits** -- Always use the tool (manual edits bypass validation)\n- **Ignore lock timeouts** -- Log and investigate when locks time out frequently\n\n### Related Patterns\n\nCombines elements of:\n- **Collect > Transform > Store** (base pipeline)\n- **Monitor > Detect > Alert** (state changes can trigger alerts)\n- **Generate > Review > Publish** (state affects generated content)\n\nOften used with:\n- **Intake > Enrich > Deliver** (state provides IDs or version numbers)\n- **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** (each parallel task gets unique ID from state)\n\n## 13.

Scrape > Process > Output\n\n**Summary:** A web scraping pipeline that fetches raw content from one or more URLs via a web-access MCP, processes and structures the data with Python (or Claude itself), and writes clean output to a target destination.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need structured data extracted from websites that lack APIs.\n- You want to convert messy HTML into clean JSON, CSV, or Markdown on a recurring schedule.\n- You are building a dataset from publicly available web content.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Define targets** -- Specify URLs, selectors, or search queries in a config file or workflow input.\n2. **Fetch raw content** -- Use a web MCP (Fetch, Puppeteer, or Playwright) to retrieve page content. Handle pagination if needed.\n3. **Parse and extract** -- Strip irrelevant markup. Pull target fields using CSS selectors, XPath, or Claude-driven semantic extraction.\n4. **Transform** -- Normalize data types, deduplicate, validate schema. Python scripts or inline Claude processing.\n5. **Output** -- Write results to a file in the repo (`data/`, `output/`), post to an API, or commit as a structured artifact.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP** -- lightweight HTTP retrieval, returns Markdown-converted content.\n- **Puppeteer / Playwright MCP** -- for JavaScript-rendered pages requiring a headless browser.\n- **Python** -- pandas, BeautifulSoup, or custom scripts for heavy transformation.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- write results to disk.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 6 * * *'   # daily at 06:00 UTC\n  workflow_dispatch:        # manual trigger\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Scrape competitor pricing pages nightly; output a CSV diff showing changes.\n- Collect job postings from three sites; normalize into a single JSON feed committed to the repo.\n- Pull public government data tables and convert to machine-readable Parquet files.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Retry with backoff** on transient HTTP errors (429, 503).\n- **Schema validation** after extraction -- if required fields are missing, flag the record rather than silently dropping it.\n- **Stale-data guard** -- if fetch returns identical content to last run, skip processing and log \"no change.\"\n- **Alert on structural change** -- if selectors return zero matches (site redesign), open a GitHub Issue for human review.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Research > Analyze > Report\n\n**Summary:** A multi-source research workflow that gathers information from diverse sources (web, APIs, local files), synthesizes findings with Claude, and produces a formatted report committed to the repository.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need to compile information from multiple sources into a single coherent document.\n- Periodic market research, competitive analysis, or literature reviews.\n- Any task where a human would spend hours reading and summarizing.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Define research brief** -- Specify the topic, questions to answer, source priorities, and output format.\n2. **Gather sources** -- Query web search, fetch specific URLs, read local reference files, call APIs.\n3. **Extract key findings** -- For each source, pull relevant facts, quotes, data points. Tag each with provenance.\n4. **Analyze and synthesize** -- Claude cross-references findings, identifies patterns, contradictions, and gaps.\n5. **Generate report** -- Produce a structured Markdown document with sections, citations, and an executive summary.\n6. **Commit and notify** -- Commit the report to the repo. Optionally open a PR or send a notification.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Web Search MCP / Fetch MCP** -- gather online sources.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read local reference documents.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit output, open issues or PRs.\n- **Claude (extended thinking)** -- deep analysis and synthesis.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'   # weekly on Monday at 09:00 UTC\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      topic:\n        description: 'Research topic'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Weekly competitive landscape report that tracks new features announced by three competitors.\n- Monthly technology radar summarizing emerging tools relevant to the team's stack.\n- Ad-hoc deep-dive report triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch` with a topic input.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Source fallback** -- if a primary source is unreachable, log it and proceed with remaining sources. Note gaps in the report.\n- **Confidence scoring** -- Claude flags low-confidence claims; the report includes a \"Caveats\" section.\n- **Minimum-source threshold** -- if fewer than N sources are successfully retrieved, abort and open an issue rather than publishing a thin report.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Monitor > Detect > Alert\n\n**Summary:** A continuous monitoring system that periodically checks a target (website, API, dataset, repo) for changes, applies detection logic, and fires alerts or triggers downstream workflows when significant changes are found.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want to be notified when something changes: a webpage, an API response, a competitor's pricing, a regulatory filing.\n- You need a lightweight, Git-native alternative to commercial monitoring SaaS.\n- Ideal for cron-triggered GitHub Actions that run on a schedule.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Fetch current state** -- Retrieve the current snapshot of the monitored target.\n2. **Load previous state** -- Read the last-known state from a file committed in the repo (e.g., `state/last_snapshot.json`).\n3. **Diff** -- Compare current vs. previous. Use structural diff for JSON, text diff for prose, hash comparison for binary.\n4. **Evaluate significance** -- Apply rules or Claude-based judgment to determine if the change is meaningful (filter noise).\n5. **Alert** -- If significant: open a GitHub Issue, send a Slack message, trigger a downstream workflow via `repository_dispatch`, or all three.\n6. **Persist new state** -- Commit the current snapshot as the new baseline.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP / Puppeteer MCP** -- retrieve current state from web targets.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write state files.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- open issues, trigger dispatches.\n- **Slack MCP** -- send alert messages.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '*/30 * * * *'  # every 30 minutes\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Monitor a government regulatory page for new filings; alert the legal team via Slack when a new document appears.\n- Watch a competitor's changelog page; open a GitHub Issue summarizing each detected update.\n- Track an API's response schema for breaking changes; alert the engineering team.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Transient failure tolerance** -- if the fetch fails, do NOT overwrite previous state. Log the failure. After N consecutive failures, escalate to an alert.\n- **False-positive suppression** -- use Claude to evaluate whether a detected \"change\" is meaningful (e.g., ignore timestamp-only diffs).\n- **State corruption recovery** -- if state file is missing or unparseable, re-initialize from scratch and log a warning instead of crashing.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Intake > Enrich > Deliver\n\n**Summary:** A data enrichment pipeline that receives raw input (from a form, webhook, file drop, or API), augments it with additional data from external sources, and delivers the enriched result to its destination.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- Incoming data is incomplete and needs augmentation before it is useful.\n- You are building a lead enrichment, content tagging, or metadata enhancement system.\n- Raw data arrives in one format and must be transformed and enriched before storage or delivery.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Intake** -- Receive raw data. Sources: webhook payload, new file in repo, manual trigger with JSON input, or a watched directory.\n2. **Validate** -- Check that required fields exist and data types are correct. Reject malformed input early.\n3. **Enrich** -- For each record, call enrichment sources: web search for context, APIs for supplementary data, Claude for classification or summarization.\n4. **Merge** -- Combine original data with enrichment results into a unified schema.\n5. **Deliver** -- Write enriched data to its destination: commit to repo, POST to API, append to a dataset file, or open a PR.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Web Search MCP** -- find supplementary information.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- call enrichment APIs.\n- **Claude** -- classify, tag, summarize, or score records.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read input, write output.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit results or open PRs.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'inbox/**'          # new file dropped in inbox\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      payload:\n        description: 'JSON data to enrich'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- A sales team drops a CSV of company names into `inbox/`; the pipeline enriches each with industry, size, website, and LinkedIn URL, then writes to `data/enriched_leads.csv`.\n- Incoming support tickets are enriched with customer history and sentiment score before routing.\n- Raw RSS feed items are enriched with summaries, topic tags, and relevance scores.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Per-record error isolation** -- if enrichment fails for one record, mark it as `enrichment_failed` and continue processing the rest. Do not let one bad record kill the batch.\n- **Rate-limit awareness** -- track API call counts; pause and retry when rate-limited rather than failing fast.\n- **Partial delivery** -- deliver successfully enriched records on schedule; queue failed records for retry in the next run.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Generate > Review > Publish\n\n**Summary:** A content generation pipeline with built-in quality gates. Claude generates draft content, a review step validates quality and compliance, and approved content is published to its destination.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- Automated content creation (blog posts, documentation, social media, release notes) where quality must be verified before publishing.\n- Any workflow where you want a \"human-in-the-loop\" approval step or an automated quality check before output goes live.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Brief** -- Define the content requirements: topic, audience, tone, length, format, and any reference material.\n2. **Generate** -- Claude produces a first draft using the brief and any provided reference material.\n3. **Automated review** -- Run quality checks: spelling/grammar, factual consistency against source material, tone analysis, compliance rules (e.g., no prohibited claims).\n4. **Gate decision** -- If automated review passes, proceed. If it fails, loop back to step 2 with feedback (max N retries). Optionally, require human approval via a PR review.\n5. **Publish** -- Commit final content to the repo, deploy to a CMS via API, or post to a platform.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Claude** -- generation and review (use separate system prompts for generator vs. reviewer to create genuine separation).\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read briefs, write drafts and final output.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- open a draft PR for human review; merge on approval.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- publish to external CMS or platform APIs.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [labeled]        # label \"content-request\" triggers generation\n  pull_request_review:\n    types: [submitted]      # human approval triggers publish\n  workflow_dispatch:\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Weekly changelog: gather merged PRs, generate a formatted changelog, open a PR for team review, publish on approval.\n- Blog post pipeline: issue labeled \"draft-request\" triggers generation; editor reviews the PR; merge triggers deployment.\n- Social media batch: generate a week's worth of posts, run brand-voice review, output approved posts to a scheduling queue.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Retry budget** -- if automated review rejects the draft, regenerate with targeted feedback up to 3 times. After that, escalate to a human by opening an issue.\n- **Rollback on publish failure** -- if the publish step fails (API error), keep the approved content in the repo and log the failure for manual retry.\n- **Diff guard** -- before publishing, diff against previously published content to prevent accidental overwrite of manual edits.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Listen > Decide > Act\n\n**Summary:** An event-driven agent that listens for incoming events (webhooks, GitHub events, messages), applies decision logic to determine the appropriate response, and takes autonomous action.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need a system that reacts to external events in near-real-time.\n- Webhook-triggered GitHub Actions are the execution engine.\n- The appropriate response depends on the content of the event (routing, triage, conditional logic).\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Receive event** -- GitHub Actions triggers on the event (webhook, issue creation, PR comment, `repository_dispatch`).\n2. **Parse and classify** -- Extract relevant data from the event payload. Use Claude to classify intent or severity if the input is unstructured (e.g., natural language).\n3. **Decide** -- Apply decision logic: rule-based routing, Claude-driven triage, or a lookup table. Determine which action(s) to take.\n4. **Act** -- Execute the chosen action: respond to the issue, trigger another workflow, call an API, update a file, or escalate to a human.\n5. **Log** -- Record the event, decision, and action taken for auditability.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **GitHub MCP** -- read event payloads, respond to issues/PRs, trigger dispatches.\n- **Claude** -- classify, triage, and decide.\n- **Slack MCP** -- notify humans when escalation is needed.\n- **Fetch MCP** -- call external APIs as part of the action.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened, labeled]\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [incoming_webhook]\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Triage bot: new issues are classified by Claude (bug, feature, question) and auto-labeled, assigned, and replied to with relevant templates.\n- Deployment gatekeeper: a PR comment like \"/deploy staging\" triggers a deployment workflow after validating the commenter's permissions.\n- Customer feedback router: webhook delivers feedback; Claude scores sentiment and routes critical items to Slack.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Idempotency** -- design actions to be safe to retry. Use event IDs to detect and skip duplicate deliveries.\n- **Decision logging** -- log the full decision chain (event > classification > decision > action) so failures can be diagnosed.\n- **Safe defaults** -- if classification confidence is low, default to escalation (notify a human) rather than taking an autonomous action that might be wrong.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Collect > Transform > Store\n\n**Summary:** A classic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline where Git serves as the data store. Data is collected from external sources, transformed into a canonical format, and committed to the repository as versioned, queryable files.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want a version-controlled data lake without standing up a database.\n- Small-to-medium datasets (tens of MB) that benefit from Git's diff, history, and branching.\n- Data pipelines where auditability and reproducibility matter more than query speed.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Collect** -- Pull data from source(s): APIs, web scrapes, file uploads, other repos.\n2. **Validate** -- Check data integrity: schema validation, null checks, type enforcement.\n3. **Transform** -- Normalize, clean, reshape. Convert to the canonical schema. Deduplicate against existing data in the store.\n4. **Diff** -- Compare transformed data against the current version in the repo. Compute what is new, changed, or deleted.\n5. **Store** -- Commit the updated dataset files to the repo. Use meaningful commit messages describing what changed (e.g., \"Add 14 new records from source X\").\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Fetch MCP** -- pull data from APIs and web sources.\n- **Python** -- pandas or custom scripts for transformation.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write data files.\n- **GitHub MCP / Git CLI** -- commit, push, branch as needed.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # every 6 hours\n  workflow_dispatch:\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Collect cryptocurrency prices from three APIs every 6 hours; store as daily CSV files in `data/prices/`.\n- Pull open government datasets weekly; transform into a normalized schema; maintain a living dataset in the repo.\n- Aggregate internal metrics from multiple microservice health endpoints; store as JSON for a dashboard.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Atomic commits** -- only commit if the entire pipeline succeeds. Never commit partial or corrupted data.\n- **Schema drift detection** -- if source data no longer matches the expected schema, abort and alert rather than storing malformed data.\n- **Rollback via Git** -- if bad data is committed, revert the commit. The previous state is always recoverable.\n- **Dedup safety** -- idempotent writes ensure that re-running the pipeline does not create duplicate records.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Fan-Out > Process > Merge\n\n**Summary:** The Agent Teams pattern. A coordinator agent splits a large task into independent sub-tasks, dispatches them to parallel sub-agents (or sequential iterations), collects all results, and merges them into a unified output.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- A task is naturally decomposable into independent units of work (e.g., process each file, research each topic, analyze each competitor).\n- You want to reduce wall-clock time by parallelizing work.\n- The final deliverable requires combining results from multiple sub-tasks.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Plan** -- The coordinator analyzes the task and determines how to decompose it. Produces a work manifest: a list of sub-tasks with their inputs.\n2. **Fan-Out** -- Dispatch each sub-task. Options: parallel GitHub Actions jobs via a matrix strategy, sequential Claude tool calls, or `repository_dispatch` events to separate workflows.\n3. **Process** -- Each sub-agent executes its sub-task independently. Results are written to a known location (e.g., `temp/results/task_01.json`).\n4. **Collect** -- The coordinator waits for all sub-tasks to complete and gathers their outputs.\n5. **Merge** -- Combine results: concatenate, deduplicate, reconcile conflicts, and produce the final unified output.\n6. **Deliver** -- Commit the merged output or pass it to the next stage in a larger pipeline.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Claude** -- coordinator logic, sub-task execution, merge logic.\n- **GitHub Actions matrix** -- parallel job execution.\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read/write intermediate and final results.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- coordinate via issues, artifacts, or dispatch events.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      task_manifest:\n        description: 'JSON array of sub-tasks'\n        required: true\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: [fan_out_request]\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Analyze 20 competitor websites: fan out one sub-agent per competitor, each produces a profile, merge into a single competitive analysis report.\n- Process a batch of 50 documents: each sub-agent summarizes one document, merge into a master summary with cross-references.\n- Multi-language translation: fan out one sub-agent per target language, merge all translations into a localized content bundle.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Partial success tolerance** -- if some sub-tasks fail, merge the successful results and report failures. Do not discard all work because of one failure.\n- **Retry failed sub-tasks** -- the coordinator can re-dispatch failed sub-tasks up to N times before giving up.\n- **Timeout enforcement** -- set a maximum wall-clock time for the fan-out phase. Collect whatever is done when the timer expires.\n- **Conflict resolution** -- if sub-task results conflict, the merge step uses Claude to reconcile or flags the conflict for human review.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Issue > Execute > PR\n\n**Summary:** The GitHub Agent HQ pattern. An agent receives a task specification via a GitHub Issue, autonomously executes the required workflow, and delivers the results as a draft Pull Request for human review.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You want a human-in-the-loop task queue where work is requested via Issues and delivered via PRs.\n- The agent should be fully autonomous in execution but the output requires human approval before merging.\n- Building an internal tool where non-technical stakeholders can request work by opening an Issue.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Receive** -- A new Issue is opened (or an existing Issue is labeled with a trigger label like `agent-task`). GitHub Actions fires.\n2. **Parse task** -- Claude reads the Issue body and extracts the task specification: what to do, inputs, constraints, expected output.\n3. **Create branch** -- Create a feature branch named after the Issue (e.g., `agent/issue-42`).\n4. **Execute** -- Run the appropriate workflow or pattern to complete the task. This might invoke any other pattern in this catalog.\n5. **Commit results** -- Commit all output files to the feature branch with clear commit messages.\n6. **Open draft PR** -- Open a draft PR linked to the original Issue. The PR body includes a summary of what was done, key decisions made, and anything that needs human attention.\n7. **Comment on Issue** -- Post a comment on the Issue linking to the PR and summarizing the outcome.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **GitHub MCP** -- read issues, create branches, commit, open PRs, post comments.\n- **Claude** -- parse task, execute logic, generate summaries.\n- **Any other MCP** -- depending on the task being executed.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  issues:\n    types: [opened, labeled]\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]       # support \"/execute\" command in comments\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- A product manager opens an Issue: \"Research top 5 CRM tools and compare features.\" The agent researches, builds a comparison table, and opens a PR with the report.\n- An engineer opens an Issue: \"Add unit tests for the auth module.\" The agent generates tests and delivers them as a PR.\n- A stakeholder opens an Issue: \"Update the pricing page data for Q1.\" The agent pulls new data, updates the files, and opens a PR for review.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Status updates** -- the agent comments on the Issue at each major step (\"Starting research...\", \"Generating report...\", \"Opening PR...\") so progress is visible.\n- **Graceful failure** -- if the agent cannot complete the task, it comments on the Issue with a clear explanation of what went wrong and what it tried, then labels the Issue `agent-failed` for human triage.\n- **Scope guard** -- if Claude determines the task is ambiguous or out of scope, it asks a clarifying question in the Issue comments rather than guessing.\n- **Draft-only PRs** -- all PRs are opened as drafts. The agent never merges its own work.\n\n---\n\n## 10. n8n Import > Translate > Deploy\n\n**Summary:** A conversion pattern that ingests an n8n workflow JSON export, translates it into a WAT-native system (Claude Code + MCP + GitHub Actions), and deploys it as a fully functional GitHub-native workflow.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You are migrating from n8n (or a similar visual workflow tool) to a GitHub-native architecture.\n- You want to leverage existing workflow logic without manually rewriting it.\n- You are evaluating whether an n8n workflow can run as a WAT system to reduce infrastructure dependencies.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Import** -- Read the n8n workflow JSON file. This contains nodes, connections, credentials references, and configuration.\n2. **Parse and map** -- Walk the node graph. For each n8n node type, identify the equivalent WAT component:\n   - HTTP Request node -> Fetch MCP call\n   - Code (JavaScript/Python) node -> inline script or Python file\n   - IF/Switch node -> Claude decision logic or conditional in workflow\n   - Webhook trigger -> `repository_dispatch` or `workflow_dispatch`\n   - Cron trigger -> `schedule` trigger in GitHub Actions\n   - Set/Merge nodes -> data transformation in Claude or Python\n3. **Translate** -- Generate the WAT system files:\n   - `.github/workflows/*.yml` -- GitHub Actions workflow definition.\n   - `prompts/` -- Claude system prompts for nodes that require AI logic.\n   - `scripts/` -- Python or shell scripts for code nodes.\n   - `config/` -- Configuration extracted from the n8n workflow.\n4. **Validate** -- Dry-run the generated workflow. Check that all node types were mapped, no credentials are hardcoded, and the control flow is correct.\n5. **Deploy** -- Commit the generated files to the repo. Open a PR with a detailed summary of the translation, noting any nodes that required manual review or could not be auto-translated.\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **filesystem MCP** -- read n8n JSON, write generated files.\n- **Claude** -- interpret node logic, generate prompts, translate code, produce workflow YAML.\n- **GitHub MCP** -- commit files, open PR.\n- **Python** -- parse n8n JSON, generate boilerplate.\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'imports/n8n/*.json'   # drop an n8n export to trigger conversion\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      n8n_file:\n        description: 'Path to n8n JSON file in the repo'\n        required: true\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Migrate a 15-node n8n lead-scoring workflow to a Git-versioned, GitHub Actions-powered system.\n- Convert an n8n social media posting pipeline into a WAT **Generate > Review > Publish** system.\n- Translate an n8n monitoring workflow into a WAT **Monitor > Detect > Alert** pattern, eliminating the need for a running n8n instance.\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Unsupported node catalog** -- maintain a list of n8n node types that cannot be auto-translated. When encountered, flag them in the PR description with a `TODO` and a suggested manual implementation.\n- **Credential safety** -- never translate credentials. Replace all credential references with GitHub Secrets placeholders (`${{ secrets.SERVICE_API_KEY }}`) and document which secrets need to be configured.\n- **Fidelity check** -- generate a side-by-side comparison of the n8n flow and the translated WAT flow so a human reviewer can verify correctness.\n- **Incremental migration** -- support translating a subset of the n8n workflow, allowing teams to migrate node-by-node rather than all-at-once.\n\n---\n\n## Pattern Composition Quick Reference\n\nPatterns are building blocks. Here are common compositions:\n\n| Composition | How It Works |\n|---|---|\n| **Monitor > Detect > Alert** + **Issue > Execute > PR** | Monitor detects a change, opens an Issue, which triggers the agent to act and deliver a PR. |\n| **Issue > Execute > PR** using **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** | A complex Issue task is decomposed and parallelized internally before the PR is opened. |\n| **Scrape > Process > Output** feeding **Collect > Transform > Store** | Scraping output is piped into the ETL pattern for versioned storage. |\n| **Listen > Decide > Act** routing to any pattern | An event-driven dispatcher that selects and triggers the appropriate pattern based on the event. |\n| **n8n Import > Translate > Deploy** producing any pattern | The translator identifies which WAT pattern best fits the n8n workflow and generates accordingly. |\n\n---\n\n## Choosing a Pattern\n\n| Question | Recommended Pattern |\n|---|---|\n| Do I need to pull data from websites? | **Scrape > Process > Output** |\n| Do I need to synthesize information from many sources? | **Research > Analyze > Report** |\n| Do I need to watch for changes over time? | **Monitor > Detect > Alert** |\n| Do I need to augment incoming data? | **Intake > Enrich > Deliver** |\n| Do I need AI-generated content with quality control? | **Generate > Review > Publish** |\n| Do I need to react to external events? | **Listen > Decide > Act** |\n| Do I need versioned data storage without a database? | **Collect > Transform > Store** |\n| Do I need to parallelize a large task? | **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** |\n| Do I need a task queue with human approval? | **Issue > Execute > PR** |\n| Do I need to migrate an n8n workflow? | **n8n Import > Translate > Deploy** |\n| Do I need B2B lead generation from web data? | **Intake > Enrich > Deliver** (lead-gen variant) |\n\n---\n\n## Proven Compositions (from builds)\n\n### Lead Generation Pipeline (lead-gen-machine)\n- **Pattern**: Intake > Enrich > Deliver + Scrape > Process > Output\n- **Flow**: Parse profile > Search web > Scrape sites > Extract contacts (Claude) > Score leads > Output CSV\n- **Key insight**: The Intake > Enrich > Deliver pattern works well when the \"enrichment\" involves multi-step web scraping + AI extraction. Each company is an independent unit of work, making this a strong candidate for Fan-Out > Process > Merge parallelization.\n- **Scoring pattern**: Decompose match criteria into independent dimensions (industry, size, location, keywords) with weighted point values. This makes the scoring transparent and tunable.\n- **Fallback chains**: Firecrawl > HTTP+BeautifulSoup for scraping, Claude > regex for extraction. Always have a degraded-but-functional fallback.\n\n### Marketing Pipeline (marketing-pipeline)\n- **Pattern**: Intake > Enrich > Deliver + Generate > Review > Publish\n- **Flow**: Ingest CSV > Enrich via Apollo/Hunter/Brave/Claude > Deep-score (5 dimensions) > Segment (Hot/Warm/Cold) > Generate outreach (Hot) > Generate nurture (Warm) > Output CSVs + emails\n- **Key insight**: Multi-API enrichment with graceful degradation. Apollo (primary) > Hunter (email verification) > Brave (research) > Claude (pain analysis). Each API layer adds value but the system works with only Anthropic API.\n- **Scoring pattern**: 5-dimension scoring (size fit, tech stack compatibility, budget signals, accessibility, pain signals) with transparent point breakdown. More dimensions = more nuanced than lead-gen-machine's 4-dimension approach.\n- **Content generation pattern**: Outreach and nurture are independent post-segmentation, making them natural Agent Teams candidates. Outreach is per-lead personalized; nurture is aggregate-informed.\n- **API fallback chain**: Apollo > Hunter > Brave > Claude > HTTP scraping. Four-level fallback with clear degradation at each level.\n- **CSV-in/CSV-out**: Accepts CSV input (compatible with lead-gen-machine output), produces segmented CSVs + markdown email sequences. Easy to chain systems.\n\n### Website Uptime Monitor (website-uptime-monitor)\n- **Pattern**: Monitor > Log (simplified from Monitor > Detect > Alert)\n- **Flow**: Check URL via HTTP GET > Measure response time > Determine up/down status > Append to CSV > Commit to Git\n- **Key insight**: Simplest possible monitoring system - no detection logic, no alerting, just raw data collection. Every check produces a log entry regardless of status. Git history IS the audit trail.\n- **No MCPs needed**: Direct Python `requests` library is simpler and more reliable than Fetch MCP for a single GET request. CSV append uses stdlib. Zero external dependencies beyond GitHub Actions.\n- **Exit code signaling**: Tool exits 0 if up, 1 if down - GitHub Actions UI shows workflow as \"failed\" when site is down, providing at-a-glance status without additional alerting logic.\n- **Concurrency handling**: GitHub Actions `concurrency` setting prevents simultaneous runs. Git push includes retry with rebase to handle rare concurrent commits.\n- **CSV as database**: Append-only CSV committed to Git provides versioned, auditable, queryable dataset. No external database needed. Git handles MB-scale data easily.\n- **Cron variance accepted**: GitHub Actions cron has ±5 minute variance - documented as expected behavior rather than a bug to fix.\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) Scheduled cron (primary), (2) Manual dispatch (testing), (3) Local CLI (development). Agent HQ (4) optional for issue-driven tasks.\n- **Cost awareness**: ~1,440 GitHub Actions minutes/month for 5-minute checks. Fits within free tier (2,000/month private, unlimited public).\n- **Extensibility points**: Add alerting by extending monitor.yml (Slack webhook, GitHub Issue). Add multiple URLs via matrix strategy or separate workflows. Add authentication via tool arguments + GitHub Secrets.\n\n### CSV-to-JSON Converter (csv-to-json-converter)\n- **Pattern**: Collect > Transform > Store\n- **Flow**: Collect CSV files > Analyze structure > Parse CSV > Infer types > Validate data > Convert to JSON/JSONL > Generate reports > Commit\n- **Key insight**: Multi-phase transformation with specialist subagents. Each phase (analyze, infer, validate, write) has a dedicated subagent with focused responsibilities. Main agent orchestrates the pipeline.\n- **Subagent architecture**: Four specialist subagents (csv-analyzer, type-inference-specialist, data-validator, json-writer) with minimal tool access. Subagents are the DEFAULT delegation mechanism, not Agent Teams.\n- **Type inference pattern**: Statistical analysis with confidence scoring (80% threshold). Detects int, float, boolean, datetime, string. Falls back to string for ambiguous columns. Handles 10+ null value representations.\n- **Encoding detection**: chardet for automatic encoding detection with UTF-8 fallback. Strips BOM (byte order mark) automatically. Supports UTF-8, Latin-1, Windows-1252, etc.\n- **Ragged row handling**: Pad short rows with null, truncate long rows with warning. Log all issues in validation report but continue processing (graceful degradation).\n- **Validation without failure**: Validator NEVER raises exceptions. Always returns a report. Strict mode controls whether issues halt the pipeline, but validation itself is fail-safe.\n- **JSONL streaming**: For large files (1M+ rows), JSONL format writes one record at a time. No array wrapper. Memory-efficient for multi-GB datasets.\n- **Batch processing modes**: Sequential (1-2 files) or parallel (3+ files with Agent Teams). Parallel is 5x faster wall time but same token cost. Always has sequential fallback.\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) CLI for local development, (2) GitHub Actions for production, (3) Agent HQ for issue-driven tasks. All three produce identical output.\n- **Metadata reporting**: run_summary.json (machine-readable) + validation_report.md (human-readable). Includes per-file stats, type inference results, validation issues, recommendations.\n- **No secrets required**: Uses only stdlib (csv, json, pathlib) + chardet + python-dateutil. No external APIs. Pure data transformation pipeline.\n- **Git commit discipline**: Stage ONLY output files (never `git add -A`). Commit message includes file count, row count, timestamp. Output directory is parameterized.\n\n### RSS Digest Monitor (rss-digest-monitor)\n- **Pattern**: Monitor > Collect > Transform > Deliver (with state persistence)\n- **Flow**: Load state > Fetch RSS feeds > Filter new posts > Generate HTML digest > Send email > Update state > Commit\n- **Key insight**: State persistence in Git prevents post duplication across runs. Composite GUID keys (feed_url::guid) prevent false deduplication. State is ONLY updated after successful email delivery, ensuring retry on failure.\n- **Subagent architecture**: Three specialist subagents (rss-fetcher-specialist, digest-generator-specialist, state-manager-specialist). Subagents are the DEFAULT delegation mechanism. Sequential execution is correct due to clear data dependencies.\n- **Per-feed error isolation**: One failed feed does NOT kill the entire run. Each feed is fetched independently with try/except. Failed feeds are logged and skipped. Graceful degradation ensures partial success.\n- **Composite GUID pattern**: Use `feed_url::entry_guid` as deduplication key instead of guid alone. Prevents false positives when different feeds use the same GUID format.\n- **State file size management**: Enforce maximum 10,000 GUIDs by keeping most recent entries. Prevents unbounded state growth. Log warning if limit is hit.\n- **Email with fallback**: MIME multipart with HTML primary and plain-text fallback. Ensures compatibility with all email clients. HTML is styled with inline CSS for maximum rendering support.\n- **Conditional email send**: Skip email generation if no new posts found. Silent run with state update only. Saves API calls and prevents empty emails.\n- **SMTP retry logic**: Retry once with 30s delay on transient failures (auth, network, timeout). Do NOT update state if email send fails -- posts retry on next run.\n- **First-run initialization**: Missing or corrupted state file initializes empty state. All posts are processed on first run. Log warning but continue (better to duplicate once than crash).\n- **Date parsing with fallback**: Use python-dateutil for robust parsing of varied date formats. If unparseable, use current timestamp. Include post anyway (better to duplicate than miss).\n- **Three execution paths**: (1) Scheduled cron at 8 AM UTC (primary), (2) Manual dispatch with force_send (testing), (3) Local CLI (development). All produce identical output.\n- **Run summary logging**: Each run produces `logs/YYYY-MM-DD_run.json` with feeds_checked, feeds_failed, new_posts, email_sent, failed_feeds array. Machine-readable audit trail.\n- **Git commit discipline**: Stage ONLY state/rss_state.json and logs/*.json. NEVER `git add -A`. Commit message includes date and post count for easy history review.\n- **No MCP dependencies**: Uses standard Python libraries (feedparser, smtplib, json, pathlib). Works out-of-the-box with only Python and requirements.txt. No external MCPs required.\n- **Cost awareness**: ~3-5 minutes per day = ~90-150 GitHub Actions minutes/month. Well within free tier (2,000/month private, unlimited public). Minimal token cost for state management only.\n\n## 11. Content Transformation with Tone Matching\n\n**Summary:** An AI-powered content repurposing pipeline that extracts content from a source URL, analyzes its tone and style, and generates platform-optimized variants (social media, email, etc.) that match the source tone automatically.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need to publish the same content across multiple platforms with different format requirements\n- Content must maintain consistent voice/tone across all platforms\n- Manual reformatting for each platform is time-consuming and error-prone\n- You want AI to handle platform-specific best practices (character limits, hashtags, formatting)\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Fetch source content** -- Scrape the source URL (blog post, article) and extract clean text/markdown. Use Firecrawl with HTTP fallback for reliability.\n2. **Analyze tone** -- Use LLM (Claude) with structured output to analyze writing style across multiple dimensions: formality, technical level, humor, primary emotion. Return confidence score.\n3. **Generate platform variants (parallel)** -- For each target platform (Twitter, LinkedIn, email, Instagram):\n   - Send source content + tone analysis to LLM\n   - Request platform-optimized output matching source tone\n   - Enforce platform-specific constraints (char limits, hashtag counts, formatting rules)\n   - Validate character counts before accepting output\n4. **Merge and output** -- Combine all variants into single JSON file with metadata, tone analysis, and all platform content\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **Firecrawl MCP** -- reliable web scraping with JS rendering support\n- **Anthropic MCP** -- Claude for tone analysis and content generation\n- **HTTP + BeautifulSoup** -- fallback scraping if Firecrawl unavailable\n- **Python stdlib** -- JSON manipulation, filename slugification, output assembly\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      blog_url:\n        description: 'Blog post URL to repurpose'\n        required: true\n  # Can also be triggered on new blog post detection via RSS or webhook\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Marketing team publishes a blog post, wants Twitter thread, LinkedIn post, email newsletter section, and Instagram caption\n- Content creator wants to maximize reach by publishing same content on all major platforms\n- Agency needs to repurpose client blog posts for multi-channel campaigns\n- Developer advocates want to turn technical blog posts into social-friendly content\n\n### Subagent Architecture\n\n- **content-scraper-specialist** -- Handles web scraping with fallback strategies\n- **tone-analyzer-specialist** -- Analyzes source content tone/style\n- **content-generator-specialist** -- Coordinates multi-platform generation (can use Agent Teams for parallelization)\n- **output-assembler-specialist** -- Merges all content into final JSON\n\n### Agent Teams Parallelization\n\nPlatform generation is ideal for Agent Teams:\n- 4 independent platform generation tasks (Twitter, LinkedIn, email, Instagram)\n- Each takes 10-15 seconds sequentially = 40-55s total\n- Parallel execution with 4 teammates = 12-18s\n- **2x speedup** with identical results and same token cost\n\n### Platform-Specific Constraints\n\n| Platform | Char Limit | Hashtags | Format Notes |\n|----------|------------|----------|--------------|\n| Twitter | 280 per tweet | 2-3 per thread | Numbered thread (1/N format), hook in first tweet, CTA in last |\n| LinkedIn | 3000 max, 1300 target | 3-5 | Professional tone, hook before \"see more\" fold, line breaks |\n| Email | 500-800 words | N/A | Subject line (40-60 chars), scannable format, HTML + plain text |\n| Instagram | 2200 max | 10-15 | Casual tone, emojis (3-5), line breaks, hook before \"more\" button |\n\n### Tone Matching Pattern\n\n1. LLM analyzes source content with structured JSON schema\n2. Returns tone profile: {formality, technical_level, humor_level, primary_emotion, confidence}\n3. Platform generators receive tone profile in their prompts\n4. Each generator adjusts output style to match source tone (formal → formal, casual → casual)\n5. Result: All platforms sound like they were written by the same person\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n- **Scraping failure** -- Halt workflow immediately (no content = can't proceed). Log clear error about paywall/404/timeout.\n- **Tone analysis failure** -- Return default neutral profile, continue with warning. Quality slightly reduced but system remains functional.\n- **Single platform failure** -- Continue with other platforms. Include error structure for failed platform in output. Partial success is acceptable.\n- **Character limit exceeded** -- Tools automatically truncate with \"...\" and log warning. Better than crashing.\n\n### Performance & Cost\n\n**Execution time**:\n- Sequential: ~52-74 seconds\n- With Agent Teams: ~25-37 seconds (2x faster)\n\n**API cost per run** (Claude Sonnet 4):\n- Scraping: $0.01-0.02 (Firecrawl)\n- LLM calls: ~$0.09 (tone + 4 platforms)\n- **Total: ~$0.10-0.11 per blog post**\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n✅ Source content extracted (≥ 100 chars)\n✅ Tone analysis returns confidence ≥ 0.5\n✅ At least 2/4 platforms generate successfully\n✅ All character counts within platform limits\n✅ Output JSON file written to repo\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n- **Tone matching is powerful** -- AI can accurately replicate writing style when given structured tone analysis\n- **Parallel generation scales well** -- 4 independent LLM calls are perfect for Agent Teams\n- **Character validation is critical** -- Must validate before returning, not after\n- **Partial success is acceptable** -- 3/4 platforms working is better than all-or-nothing\n- **Firecrawl + fallback pattern works** -- Primary API with HTTP backup maximizes reliability\n- **Subagent specialization reduces complexity** -- Each subagent has clear, scoped responsibility\n\n### Related Patterns\n\nCombines elements of:\n- **Scrape > Process > Output** (content extraction)\n- **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** (parallel platform generation via Agent Teams)\n- **Generate > Review > Publish** (content creation with validation)\n\n## 12. Sequential State Management Pipeline\n\n**Summary:** A data transformation pipeline that maintains persistent state across runs using atomic file operations. Each execution reads current state, transforms data, generates output, updates state, and commits results -- all while preventing race conditions.\n\n### When to Use\n\n- You need sequential numbering or versioning that persists across workflow runs\n- Output depends on previous runs (counters, IDs, sequence numbers)\n- Concurrent execution must not create duplicates\n- State must survive container/server restarts\n- Git-native state storage is preferred over external databases\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Read State** -- Load previous state from committed file\n2. **Lock State** -- Acquire file lock to prevent concurrent modifications\n3. **Transform Data** -- Process input using current state\n4. **Update State** -- Increment counter, add ID, update version\n5. **Generate Output** -- Produce artifacts using updated state\n6. **Commit State** -- Write state file and outputs to repo\n7. **Release Lock** -- Allow next execution to proceed\n\n### Key Tools / MCPs\n\n- **filelock** (Python) -- Atomic file locking with timeout\n- **Git** -- State file versioning and recovery\n- **filesystem MCP** -- Read/write state files\n- **JSON** (stdlib) -- State serialization\n\n### GitHub Actions Trigger\n\n```yaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      data:\n        description: 'Input data to process'\n        required: true\n  push:\n    paths:\n      - 'input/**'\n```\n\n### Example Use Cases\n\n- Invoice generator with sequential invoice numbers (INV-1001, INV-1002...)\n- Document versioning system (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0...)\n- Sequential ID assignment for records\n- Incrementing batch job numbers\n- Auto-incrementing PR numbers in custom systems\n\n### State File Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"last_value\": 1042,\n  \"prefix\": \"INV-\",\n  \"padding\": 4,\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"last_updated\": \"2026-02-11T14:30:00Z\",\n    \"total_count\": 1042\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Atomic Operations Pattern\n\n```python\nfrom filelock import FileLock, Timeout\n\nlock_path = f\"{state_file}.lock\"\ntry:\n    with FileLock(lock_path, timeout=5):\n        # Read current state\n        state = json.loads(Path(state_file).read_text())\n        \n        # Modify state\n        state[\"last_value\"] += 1\n        \n        # Write updated state\n        Path(state_file).write_text(json.dumps(state, indent=2))\n        \n        # Return new value\n        return state[\"last_value\"]\nexcept Timeout:\n    # Fallback: use timestamp or other unique value\n    return generate_fallback_value()\n```\n\n### Failure Handling\n\n**Lock timeout (5 seconds)**\n- **Cause**: Concurrent execution or filesystem issue\n- **Action**: Use fallback mechanism (timestamp, UUID, or queue for retry)\n- **Log**: Warning with details for investigation\n- **Continue**: Workflow proceeds with fallback value\n\n**State file missing**\n- **Cause**: First run or file deleted\n- **Action**: Initialize to default starting value\n- **Log**: Info message about initialization\n- **Continue**: Normal operation from initial state\n\n**State file corrupted**\n- **Cause**: Incomplete write, manual edit, merge conflict\n- **Action**: Restore from Git history or reinitialize\n- **Log**: Error with corrupted content\n- **Halt**: Require manual intervention (prevents data loss)\n\n**Concurrent modifications**\n- **Prevented by**: File locking ensures only one process modifies at a time\n- **If lock fails**: Fallback prevents workflow failure\n- **Trade-off**: Fallback may break sequential ordering but ensures system continues\n\n### Git-Native State Management\n\nState files are committed to the repository:\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Version history (full audit trail)\n- Rollback capability (`git checkout HEAD~5 state.json`)\n- Merge conflict detection\n- No external database needed\n- Free hosting on GitHub\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Not suitable for high-frequency updates (>100/min)\n- Commit overhead (~1-2 seconds per update)\n- Repo size impact (minimal for small JSON files)\n\n### Fallback Strategies\n\nWhen atomic state update fails, use one of these fallbacks:\n\n| Strategy | When to Use | Trade-off |\n|----------|-------------|-----------|\n| **Timestamp** | Unique value needed, order not critical | Breaks sequential numbering |\n| **UUID** | Unique value needed, no pattern required | No human-readable sequence |\n| **Queue for retry** | Sequential order is critical | Delays processing |\n| **Range allocation** | High concurrency expected | More complex state management |\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**GitHub Actions:**\n```yaml\nsteps:\n  - name: Get next value\n    id: state\n    run: |\n      python tools/manage_state.py state.json get_next > output.json\n      VALUE=$(jq -r '.value' output.json)\n      echo \"VALUE=$VALUE\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n  \n  - name: Use value\n    run: |\n      process_data.py --id ${{ steps.state.outputs.VALUE }}\n  \n  - name: Commit state\n    run: |\n      git add state.json output/*\n      git commit -m \"Process ID ${{ steps.state.outputs.VALUE }}\"\n      git push\n```\n\n### Success Criteria\n\n- State file exists and is valid JSON\n- Lock acquired within timeout (5 seconds)\n- State incremented correctly\n- Output files reference correct state value\n- State file committed (or queued for commit)\n- Audit trail complete (log entry written)\n\n### Performance Characteristics\n\n- **Lock acquisition**: < 100ms (no contention) to 5s (with contention)\n- **State read/write**: < 50ms (small JSON files)\n- **Git commit**: 1-2 seconds\n- **Total overhead**: 2-7 seconds per execution\n\n**Bottleneck:** Git commit (unavoidable for state persistence)\n\n### Key Learnings (from invoice-generator build)\n\n- **Lock timeout must have fallback** -- Never let locking failure halt the workflow\n- **Initialize on missing file** -- Don't fail on first run\n- **Timestamp fallback works** -- Breaks sequence but ensures uniqueness\n- **Audit log is separate** -- State update and audit logging are independent\n- **State-before-output** -- Update state BEFORE generating output (prevents duplicate detection)\n- **Decimal for currency** -- Use Decimal type when state affects financial calculations\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- **No locking** -- Race conditions create duplicates\n- **Hardcoded initial value** -- Make it configurable\n- **Fail without fallback** -- Lock timeout should not crash the system\n- **Update state after output** -- Output first, then state (wrong order leads to duplicates on failure)\n- **Manual state edits** -- Always use the tool (manual edits bypass validation)\n- **Ignore lock timeouts** -- Log and investigate when locks time out frequently\n\n### Related Patterns\n\nCombines elements of:\n- **Collect > Transform > Store** (base pipeline)\n- **Monitor > Detect > Alert** (state changes can trigger alerts)\n- **Generate > Review > Publish** (state affects generated content)\n\nOften used with:\n- **Intake > Enrich > Deliver** (state provides IDs or version numbers)\n- **Fan-Out > Process > Merge** (each parallel task gets unique ID from state)\n\n## 13.

This registry helps with tool selection, but any API accessible via HTTP can be wrapped as a Python tool.\n\n---\n\n## Media Processing\n\n### NCA Toolkit (Self-Hosted)\n- **Description**: Self-hosted media processing API running at `https://media.wat-factory.cloud`. Replaces services like CloudConvert, Placid, and PDF.co. Handles audio, video, image conversion, transcription, captioning, and more.\n- **Base URL**: `https://media.wat-factory.cloud`\n- **Auth**: `x-api-key` header with `NCA_API_KEY` environment variable\n- **Key Capabilities**:\n  - Transcribe audio/video to text (Whisper) — `POST /v1/media/transcribe`\n  - Convert media between formats — `POST /v1/media/convert`\n  - Convert to MP3 — `POST /v1/media/convert/mp3`\n  - Add captions to video — `POST /v1/video/caption`\n  - Concatenate videos — `POST /v1/video/concatenate`\n  - Concatenate audio — `POST /v1/audio/concatenate`\n  - Trim video — `POST /v1/video/trim`\n  - Cut segments from video — `POST /v1/video/cut`\n  - Split video — `POST /v1/video/split`\n  - Extract thumbnail — `POST /v1/video/thumbnail`\n  - Screenshot webpage — `POST /v1/image/screenshot/webpage`\n  - Convert image to video — `POST /v1/image/convert/video`\n  - Download media from URL (yt-dlp) — `POST /v1/BETA/media/download`\n  - Detect silence — `POST /v1/media/silence`\n  - Extract metadata — `POST /v1/media/metadata`\n  - Generate ASS subtitles — `POST /v1/media/generate/ass`\n  - Upload to S3/R2 — `POST /v1/s3/upload`\n  - Run FFmpeg commands — `POST /v1/ffmpeg/compose`\n  - Execute Python code — `POST /v1/code/execute/python`\n  - Test connectivity — `GET /v1/toolkit/test`\n  - Check job status — `GET /v1/toolkit/job/status?job_id=<id>`\n- **Common Use Cases**: Video transcription, audio/video format conversion, auto-captioning videos for social media, webpage screenshots, media downloading, thumbnail extraction\n- **Tool Pattern**:\n  ```python\n  import os, requests\n  from urllib.parse import quote\n\n  NCA_URL = \"https://media.wat-factory.cloud\"\n  R2_PUBLIC = \"https://pub-b692c36a8374480593a007a38bc7116c.r2.dev\"\n  headers = {\"x-api-key\": os.environ[\"NCA_API_KEY\"], \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"}\n\n  # === YouTube Transcription (two-step process) ===\n  # Step 1: Download the video (uses yt-dlp, stores on R2)\n  dl = requests.post(f\"{NCA_URL}/v1/BETA/media/download\", headers=headers, json={\n      \"media_url\": \"https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\"\n  }).json()\n\n  # Step 2: Get the filename from the response and build the PUBLIC R2 URL\n  # IMPORTANT: The storage URL returned uses the private R2 endpoint which is not accessible.\n  # You MUST use the public R2 dev URL instead.\n  # IMPORTANT: Filenames often contain spaces, parentheses, and unicode characters.\n  # You MUST URL-encode the filename.\n  filename = dl[\"response\"][\"media\"][\"media_url\"].split(\"/nca-media/\")[-1]\n  public_url = f\"{R2_PUBLIC}/{filename}\"  # filename is already URL-encoded from the response\n\n  # Step 3: Transcribe using the public URL\n  transcript = requests.post(f\"{NCA_URL}/v1/media/transcribe\", headers=headers, json={\n      \"media_url\": public_url\n  }).json()\n  text = transcript[\"response\"][\"text\"]\n\n  # === Direct media transcription (non-YouTube, publicly accessible URL) ===\n  resp = requests.post(f\"{NCA_URL}/v1/media/transcribe\", headers=headers, json={\n      \"media_url\": \"https://example.com/audio.mp3\"\n  })\n\n  # === Screenshot a webpage ===\n  resp = requests.post(f\"{NCA_URL}/v1/image/screenshot/webpage\", headers=headers, json={\n      \"url\": \"https://example.com\",\n      \"width\": 1920,\n      \"height\": 1080\n  })\n  ```\n- **Secret**: `NCA_API_KEY`\n- **Fallback**: Direct FFmpeg via subprocess (limited — no transcription, no cloud upload)\n- **CRITICAL NOTES**:\n  - The `/v1/media/transcribe` endpoint does NOT support YouTube URLs directly. You MUST first download via `/v1/BETA/media/download`, then transcribe the downloaded file.\n  - The `media_url` returned by the download endpoint uses the private R2 storage URL (`fa8408d96e71300f9e63b83ad7177384.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`). This URL is NOT publicly accessible. Replace the domain with the public R2 URL: `pub-b692c36a8374480593a007a38bc7116c.r2.dev`\n  - All field names use `media_url` (not `url`), except for screenshot which uses `url`.\n  - Transcription runs Whisper on CPU. A 20-minute video takes ~3-4 minutes. Set request timeouts accordingly (at least 600 seconds).\n  - Supports async processing with `webhook_url` parameter for long-running jobs.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771028523101}}

Drop a content JSON file into `input/queue/` OR trigger via `workflow_dispatch` with inline content\n2. The system validates the content, uploads media to Instagram, creates a container, and publishes\n3. If publication fails, the system retries with exponential backoff and logs detailed error information\n4. Results are written to `output/published/` (success) or `output/failed/` (failure) with full metadata\n5. Status reports are committed to the repo with timestamps, post IDs, and error details\n\n### Success Criteria\n- [ ] Accepts content via file drop (`input/queue/*.json`) or manual dispatch (JSON payload)\n- [ ] Validates all required fields (caption, image_url, business_account_id) before attempting publish\n- [ ] Successfully publishes images to Instagram Business accounts via Graph API\n- [ ] Handles Instagram API errors gracefully with 3 retry attempts and exponential backoff\n- [ ] Logs all publish attempts with timestamps, status, post ID (if success), and error details\n- [ ] Commits results to repo: success → `output/published/`, failure → `output/failed/`\n- [ ] System runs autonomously via GitHub Actions on schedule (e.g., every 15 minutes to process queue)\n- [ ] All three execution paths work: CLI (local testing), GitHub Actions (production), Agent HQ (issue-driven)\n- [ ] No secrets are hardcoded — all API keys come from GitHub Secrets or .env\n\n---\n\n## Inputs\nContent to be published to Instagram.\n\n```yaml\n- name: \"content_payload\"\n  type: \"JSON\"\n  source: \"File drop in input/queue/*.json OR workflow_dispatch input parameter\"\n  required: true\n  description: \"Instagram post content with caption, image URL, and metadata\"\n  example: |\n    {\n      \"caption\": \"Check out our latest product! #marketing #business\",\n      \"image_url\": \"https://example.com/images/product.jpg\",\n      \"business_account_id\": \"17841405309211844\",\n      \"alt_text\": \"Product photo showing new feature\",\n      \"hashtags\": [\"#marketing\", \"#business\", \"#product\"],\n      \"scheduled_time\": \"2026-02-15T10:00:00Z\"\n    }\n\n- name: \"publishing_schedule\"\n  type: \"cron expression\"\n  source: \".github/workflows/publish.yml schedule trigger\"\n  required: false\n  description: \"Cron schedule for processing the queue (e.g., every 15 minutes)\"\n  example: \"*/15 * * * *\"\n\n- name: \"business_account_id\"\n  type: \"string\"\n  source: \"Content payload OR environment variable\"\n  required: true\n  description: \"Instagram Business Account ID (from Graph API)\"\n  example: \"17841405309211844\"\n```\n\n## Outputs\nPublished posts, status reports, and error logs.\n\n```yaml\n- name: \"publish_success\"\n  type: \"JSON\"\n  destination: \"output/published/{timestamp}_{post_id}.json\"\n  description: \"Successful publish result with post ID, timestamp, and metadata\"\n  example: |\n    {\n      \"status\": \"published\",\n      \"post_id\": \"17895695668004550\",\n      \"permalink\": \"https://www.instagram.com/p/ABC123/\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-14T12:21:57Z\",\n      \"caption\": \"Check out our latest product!\",\n      \"image_url\": \"https://example.com/images/product.jpg\",\n      \"business_account_id\": \"17841405309211844\"\n    }\n\n- name: \"publish_failure\"\n  type: \"JSON\"\n  destination: \"output/failed/{timestamp}_{hash}.json\"\n  description: \"Failed publish result with error details and retry count\"\n  example: |\n    {\n      \"status\": \"failed\",\n      \"error_code\": \"OAuthException\",\n      \"error_message\": \"Invalid OAuth access token\",\n      \"retry_count\": 3,\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-14T12:21:57Z\",\n      \"caption\": \"Check out our latest product!\",\n      \"image_url\": \"https://example.com/images/product.jpg\",\n      \"business_account_id\": \"17841405309211844\"\n    }\n\n- name: \"publish_report\"\n  type: \"Markdown\"\n  destination: \"logs/{date}_publish_report.md\"\n  description: \"Daily summary of all publish attempts (success/failure breakdown)\"\n  example: |\n    # Instagram Publish Report - 2026-02-14\n    \n    ## Summary\n    - Total attempts: 12\n    - Successful: 10\n    - Failed: 2\n    \n    ## Failed Posts\n    1.

Pipeline passes Level 3 (integration test with real API)\n- [ ] workflow.md has failure modes and fallbacks for every step\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md documents all tools, subagents, MCPs, and secrets\n- [ ] .github/workflows/publish.yml has timeout-minutes (30) and failure notifications\n- [ ] .env.example lists all required environment variables with descriptions\n- [ ] .gitignore excludes .env, __pycache__/, input/queue/, output/\n- [ ] README.md covers all three execution paths (CLI, Actions, Agent HQ)\n- [ ] No hardcoded secrets anywhere in the codebase\n- [ ] Subagent files (.claude/agents/*.md) have valid YAML frontmatter\n- [ ] requirements.txt lists all Python dependencies with versions\n- [ ] Instagram API rate limit handling implemented (exponential backoff)\n- [ ] Error codes properly categorized (retryable vs non-retryable)\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n- Do not hardcode INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN or any credentials — use GitHub Secrets or .env\n- Do not use `git add -A` or `git add .` — stage only specific output files\n- Do not skip Level 3 integration tests — Instagram API has subtle error behaviors\n- Do not retry on invalid token errors (190) — these are permanent failures\n- Do not publish without validating caption length and hashtag count first\n- Do not assume image URL is accessible — always validate with HEAD request\n- Do not ignore rate limit errors — implement exponential backoff\n- Do not create MCP-dependent tools without HTTP fallback\n- Do not design subagents that call other subagents — only main agent delegates\n- Do not use Agent Teams for single posts — overhead is not justified\n- Do not commit .env files or API tokens to the repository\n- Do not publish the container ID returned from create step — publish the POST_ID\n- Do not forget to handle the async nature of container creation (1-2 second delay)\n\n---\n\n## Confidence Score: 9/10\n\n**Score rationale:**\n- **Instagram Graph API integration**: High confidence — API is well-documented, error codes are clear, retry strategies are proven — Confidence: high\n- **Content validation logic**: High confidence — requirements are explicit (caption length, hashtag count, image format), validation is straightforward — Confidence: high\n- **Error handling and fallback**: High confidence — Instagram error codes are documented, retry vs fail-fast logic is clear — Confidence: high\n- **Workflow pattern selection**: High confidence — Intake > Enrich > Deliver fits perfectly, proven pattern from library — Confidence: high\n- **Subagent architecture**: High confidence — Clear separation of concerns (validate, publish, fallback, report), no circular dependencies — Confidence: high\n- **Agent Teams decision**: High confidence — 3+ Independent Tasks Rule applies for batch processing, sequential fallback is simple — Confidence: high\n- **Tool implementations**: High confidence — All tools have clear inputs/outputs, reusable patterns from catalog, retry logic defined — Confidence: high\n- **Validation strategy**: High confidence — Three-level validation with real API test is robust — Confidence: high\n- **Secrets management**: High confidence — All secrets via GitHub Secrets or .env, no hardcoding — Confidence: high\n- **Edge case handling**: Medium confidence — Image accessibility validation and container processing delay need real-world testing — Confidence: medium\n\n**Ambiguity flags** (areas requiring clarification before building):\n- [ ] NONE — All requirements are clear and well-specified\n\n**Ready to build: YES** — No ambiguity flags, confidence score 9/10, all patterns and tools are well-defined.\n\n---\n\n## Factory Build Prompt\n\nWhen this PRP is ready, execute the build with:\n\n```\n/execute-prp PRPs/instagram-publisher.md\n```\n\nThis will trigger `factory/workflow.md` with the above requirements as structured
